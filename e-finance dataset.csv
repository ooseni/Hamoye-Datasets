This is often challenging since these businesses are and remain responsible for regulatory compliance and data protection, even though cloud providers may do their best to offer (data) protection. Meanwhile, data protection techniques evolve and get better because of continuous research and improvement of advanced encryption. Numerous cryptographic tactics have been proposed, e.g., searchable symmetric encryption (SSE) and homomorphic encryption (HE), that support search and aggregation functions on encrypted data. Each of these tactics has a trade-off between security, performance and functionality, but there is no one-size-fits-all solution. For the application developer, the underpinning concepts of these tactics are complex to comprehend, complex to integrate in a distributed application, and prone to implementation mistakes. In this paper we present DataBlinder, a distributed data access middleware that provides crypto agility by means of configurable fine-grained data protection at the application level. DataBlinder supports adaptive runtime selection of data protection tactics, and offers a plugin architecture for such tactics based on a key abstraction model for protection level, performance and supported query functionality. We have developed this middleware in close collaboration with businesses that face these challenges and offer cloud-based applications in e-finance, and e-health, by implementing and integrating state-of-the-art cryptographic schemes to DataBlinder. This paper illustrates the case of medical data protection with FHIR-compliant [30] medical data. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Data protection; Middleware; Security and privacy","Cryptography;

This paper establishes the enterprise performance evaluation system based on three dimensions, i.e. finance, society and ecology, from the new perspective of environmental value chain. Afterwards, performances of three ocean shipping enterprises, are evaluated by building the overall, static, dynamic and comprehensive scoring models. The results show that the improvement of comprehensive enterprise performance should take into account the balance between the three dimensions, as well as the timely adjustment of strategic planning based on the current strengths and weaknesses of enterprises, in order to achieve an all-win situation among the enterprises, society and ecology. © Coastal Education and Research Foundation, Inc. 2019.","analytic hierarchy process; Environmental value chain; ocean shipping enterprise; performance evaluation system; sustainable development","analytical hierarchy process; industrial enterprise; industrial performance; marine environment; shipping; valuation",,,,,,"*Corresponding author: 312809615@qq.com ©Coastal Education and Research Foundation, Inc. 2019",,"Boczon, A., Dudzinska, M., Kowalska, A., Effect of thinning on evaporation of scots pine forest (2016) Applied Ecology and Environmental Research, 14, pp. 367-379; Brian, M., Structure and antioxidant activity of extracellular polysaccharides from antarctic marine filamentous fungi (2018) CCAMLR Science, 25 (1), pp. 49-55; Chen, Y.L., Zou, H., Research on corporate performance evaluation system: Based on environmental value chain (2012) Reform of Economic System, 2, pp. 118-122; Cross, K.F., Lynch, R.L., Tailoring performance measures to suit your business (1990) Journal of Accounting and EOP, 66, p. 17; (2002) Sustainability Reporting Guidelines, , Global Reporting Initiative Secretariat; Huang, H.H., Liu, Z.F., Liu, G.F., Guo, W.X., Product environmental value chain analysis (2006) Systems Engineering Theory Methodology Applications, 3, pp. 210-214; Kang, L., Du, H.L., Du, X., Wang, H.T., Ma, W.L., Wang, M.L., Zhang, F.B., Study on dye wastewater treatment of tunable conductivity solid-waste-based composite cementitious material catalyst (2018) Desalination and Water Treatment, 125, pp. 296-301; Kaplan, R., Norton, D., The balanced scorecard-Measures that drive performance (1992) Harvard Business Review, January-February, 156, pp. 71-79; Kim, N.Y., Jeon, E.J., Jung, S.H., Ahn, S.J., Park, M.A., Seo, J.S., Gene expression profiling and expression analysis of freshwater shrimp (neocaridina denticulata denticulata) using expressed sequence tags and short-term exposure to copper (2018) Journal of Environmental Biology, 39, pp. 51-57; Liu, Z., Economic analysis of energy production from coal/biomass upgrading; Part 1: Hydrogen production (2018) Energy Sources Part B-Economics Planning and Policy, 13, pp. 132-136; Naidu, M.T., Premavani, D., Suthari, S., Venkaiah, M., Assessment of tree diversity in tropical deciduous forests of Northcentral Eastern Ghats, India (2018) Geology, Ecology, and Landscapes, 2 (3), pp. 216-227; Neely, A., Adams, C., The new spectrum: How the performance prism framework helps (2003) Business Performance Management, 2, pp. 39-47; Oganesyan, S.S., Shamsunov, S.K., Civilizational mentality and environmental problems (2018) Ekoloji, 27, pp. 1639-1644; Panagiotidis, P., Effraimis, A., Xydis, G.A., An R-based forecasting approach for efficient demand response strategies in autonomous micro-grids (2019) Energy & Environment, 30 (1), pp. 63-80; Porter, M.E., Van Der Linde, C., Green and competitive: Ending the stalemate (1995) Harvard Business Review, 73, pp. 120-134; Singh, G., Jain, V.K., Singh, A., Adaptive network architecture and firefly algorithm for biogas heating model aided by photovoltaic thermal greenhouse system (2018) Energy & Environment, 29 (7), pp. 1073-1097; Srinivas, K., Sundarapandian, S., Biomass and carbon stocks of trees in tropical dry forest of East Godavari region, Andhra Pradesh, India (2019) Geology, Ecology, and Landscapes, 3 (2), pp. 114-122; Zhang, X.E., Research on enterprise performance evaluation index system under the framework of sustainable development strategy: Based on value chain creation and ""environmental ecology"" (2009) Communication of Finance and Accounting, 35, pp. 26-27","Xiong, H.; School of Management, Nanchang UniversityChina; email: 312809615@qq.com",,,"Coastal Education Research Foundation Inc.",,,,,07490208,,JCRSE,,"English","J.

However, the inefficient transaction processing speed, which hinders the BC’s widespread, has not been well tackled yet. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture, called Dual-Channel Parallel Broadcast model (DCPB), which could address such a problem to a greater extent by using three methods which are dual communication channels, parallel pipeline processing and block broadcast strategy. In the dual-channel model, one channel processes transactions, and the other engages in the execution of BFT. The parallel pipeline processing allows the system to operate asynchronously. The block generation strategy improves the efficiency and speed of processing. Extensive experiments have been applied to BeihangChain, a simplified prototype for BC system, illustrates that its transaction processing speed could be improved to 16K transaction per second which could well support many real-world scenarios such as BC-based energy trading system and Micro-film copyright trading system in CCTV. © 2018, Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","blockchain; concurrency; consensus algorithm; dual-channel model; parallel pipeline; performance","Blockchain; Boron carbide; Commerce; Internet of things; Pipeline processing systems; Pipelines; concurrency; Consensus algorithms; Dual channel; Intellectual property protection; Internet of thing (IOT); performance; Security and reliabilities; Transaction processing; Computer architecture",,,,,"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program): 2017YFB1400200

Materials and Methods: Eighty-one young adults (16–21 years old) with CP and with normal or slightly decreased cognitive function participated in this study. Assessments were made using the Rotterdam Transition Profile (RTP) and the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS 2.0). In the binary regression model, levels of participation (RTP scores) were set as dependents and the level of disability (WHODAS 2.0 scores), age, and level of gross motor function were set as independent variables. Results: In the age group <18 years, in three out of seven RTP domains, less than 10% of participants were in phase 2 (experimenting and orientating toward the future), i.e., finance—7%, housing—7%, sexuality—4%. In the age group ≥18 years, 21% (education and employment), 56% (intimate relationships), and 59% (sexuality) of the participants were in phase 0 (no experience). Higher scores in WHODAS 2.0 domains showed positive associations with RTP domains, i.e., cognition with social activities, mobility with transportation, self-care with sexuality and transportation, and life activities with transportation. Age was positively associated with education and employment, finance, housing, and sexuality. Low motor function according to the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) had negative associations with autonomy in social activities, sexuality, and transportation. Conclusions: Young adults with cerebral palsy showed low levels of autonomy in all domains of participation. When addressing a person’s improvement in terms of their participation, the promotion of abilities in cognition, mobility, self-care, and life activities should be attempted. Age and gross motor function influenced autonomy in participation, but not in all domains. © 2019 by the authors.

This study aims to investigate the impact of information and communication technology (ICT) on the financial development index of six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries from the period 2000 to 2016. The results are reported in terms of two main ICT variables: fixed broadband and Internet users as a proxy of ICT and domestic credit to private sector as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) and broad money supply/GDP as two proxies of the financial development index. This methodology used fixed effects (FEs) estimations, and the results show that an increase in fixed broadband has a statistically significant and positive effect on both proxies of financial development. In terms of domestic credit as a percentage of the GDP proxy, the positive effects of ICT (broadband) are greater than the one from Internet users. A 1% increase in fixed broadband leads to approximately 2% increase in financial development, but the Internet user variable resulted in about a 0.09% increase. The other money supply proxy increased by 0.40% when ICT increased by 1%. Additionally, money supply increased by 0.11% when the Internet user ratio increased by 1%.To control for the endogeneity problem, the study used a generalized method of moments estimator, and the results confirm the previous results of the FE. Moreover, the negative impact of economic growth and natural resources was found to be valid and significant, while urbanization and trade openness were found to significantly and positively affect both financial development proxies. The main conclusion of the study is that GCC countries should take action in building an effective joint information system to help construct efficient economic sectors. © The Author(s) 2019.","E-finance; economic growth; financial development; GCC countries; Information and communication technology (ICT)",,,,,,,,,"Sassi, S., Goaied, M., Financial development, ICT diffusion and economic growth: lessons from MENA region (2013) Telecommun Policy, 37, pp. 252-261; Ashrafi, R., Murtaza, M., Use of the impact of ICT on SMEs in Oman (2008) Electron J Inf Syst Eval, 11, pp. 125-138; Jensen, R., The digital provide: information (technology), market performance, and welfare in the South Indian fisheries sector (2007) Q J Econ, 122 (3), pp. 879-824; Asongu, S.A., Nwachukwu, J.C., Tchamyou, V.S., Information asymmetry and financial development dynamics in Africa (2016) Rev Dev Finance, 6 (2), pp. 126-138; Spanos, Y., Prastacos, E., The relationship between information and communication technology adoption and management (2002) Int J Inf Manage, 39 (8), pp. 659-670; Chowdhury, S., Investments in ICT-capital and economic performance of small and medium scale enterprises in East Africa (2006) J Int Dev, 18 (4), pp. 533-552; Asongu, S., De Moor, L., Financial globalisation dynamic thresholds for financial development: evidence from Africa (2017) Eur J Dev Res, 29 (1), pp. 192-212; Coccorese, P., Information sharing, market competition and antitrust intervention: a lesson from the Italian insurance sector (2012) Appl Econ, 44 (3), pp. 351-359; Donner, J., The use of mobile phones by micro entrepreneurs in Kigali, Rwanda: changes to social and business networks (2006) Inf Technol Int Dev, 3 (2), pp. 3-19; Costello, G.J., Donnellan, B., IT-enabled R&D for business value in a global framework (2016) J Knowl Econ, 7 (3), pp. 783-796; Dewan, S., Ramaprasad, J., Social media, traditional media and music sales (2014) MIS Quart, 38 (1), pp. 101-128; (2013) The global information technology report, digitization for economic growth and job creation, , http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GITR_Report_2013.pdf, accessed 10 July 2018; (2010) ICTs for development: improving policy coherence, , Paris, OECD; (2002) Information and communication technologies: a World Bank Group Strategy, , Washington, DC, World Bank; Pradhan, R.P., Mallik, G., Bagchi, T.P., Information communication technology (ICT) infrastructure and economic growth: a causality evinced by cross-country panel data (2018) IIMB Manage Rev, 30, pp. 91-103; Waverman, L., Meloria, M., Melvyn, F., The impact of telecoms on economic growth in developing countries (2005) The Vodafone Policy Paper Series, (2), pp. 10-23. , 3; Yi, M., Choi, C., The effect of the internet on inflation: panel data evidence (2005) J Policy Model, 27, pp. 885-889; Lechman, E., Marszk, A., ICT technologies and financial innovations: the case of exchange traded funds in Brazil, Japan, Mexico, South Korea and the United States (2015) Technol Forecast Soc Change, 99, pp. 355-376; https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Pages/publications/mis2016.aspx, 2016, accessed 1 September 2018; Tcheng, H., Huet, J.M., Viennois, I., Telecoms and development in Africa: The chicken or the egg?

Image encryption and watermarking can effectively protect information from unauthorized access. This paper introduces a new vigorous symmetric optical image encryption and watermarking technique. This technique depends on a novel dynamic delay chaotic hopping pattern (DDCHP) combined with double random phase encoding (DRPE). To get a robust watermark image, the plain image is first watermarked with a binary secret message using a new chaotic hopping pattern (CHP) and then encrypted using a DRPE system that is controlled by double random independent keys generated with double DDCHP. In this symmetric cryptosystem, three different chaotic maps are used to enlarge the key space of the proposed cryptosystem against brute-force attack and overcome the linearity and vulnerable of the classical DRPE. The system keys are hypersensitive and their initial parameters are selected carefully. Security scrutiny proves the efficiency of the suggested cryptosystem. Therefore, the obtained simulation results prove that the cryptosystem is robust enough against the known attacks, such as statistical attack (uniform histograms of different encrypted images, correlation coefficients between the plain and the encrypted image is as low as 5.46 × 10−6), differential attack (99.99% NPCR and 38.6% UACI), brute force attack (large enough key space), and entropy attack. Moreover, the robustness of the watermark (secret message) is proved due to the solidity of CHP. The proposed approach can be used in different implementations like secure military communications, e-finance, e-healthcare, authenticated multimedia broadcasting, etc. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","DDCHP; DRPE; Hopping pattern; Secret message; Security attacks; Watermarking","Chaotic systems; Digital watermarking; Encoding (symbols); Geometrical optics; Image processing; Image watermarking; Military communications; Optical data processing; Signal encoding; Watermarking; DDCHP; DRPE; Hopping patterns; Secret messages; Security attacks; Cryptography",,,,,,,,"Abuturab, M.R., Asymmetric multiple information cryptosystem based on chaotic spiral phase mask and random spectrum decomposition (2018) Opt.

In the literature on blockchains, it is found that most articles focused on their engineering implementation, while little attention has been devoted to the exploration of theoretical aspects of the system; however, the existing work is limited to model the mining process only. In this paper, a queuing theory-based model is proposed for understanding the working and theoretical aspects of the blockchain. We validate our proposed model using the actual statistics of two popular cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, by running simulations for two months of transactions. The obtained performance measures parameters such as the Number of Transactions per block, Mining Time of Each Block, System Throughput, Memorypool count, Waiting Time in Memorypool, Number of Unconfirmed Transactions in the Whole System, Total Number of Transactions, and Number of Generated Blocks; these values are compared with actual statistics. It was found that the results gained from our proposed model are in good agreement with actual statistics. Although the simulation in this paper presents the modeling of blockchain-based cryptocurrencies only, the proposed model can be used to represent a wide range of blockchain-based systems. © 2019, MDPI AG.

AI will enable low-income countries to leapfrog in several sectors, including e-governance, e-finance, e-health, and e-education. Yet AI will also lead to automation, reducing the demand for labor, especially unskilled labor. Labor-intensive sectors such as apparel will provide fewer jobs, and lower export earnings.

The methodological basis of the study was the principles of modern post-classical science: contextuality, constructivism, anthropocentrism. The authors emphasize that digital technology is changing the entire communications system in modern society. The impact of digitalization processes on social relations occurs, first of all, due to their influence on the mentality and legal consciousness of the subjects of these relations. The article identifies and substantiates the main directions of the impact of digital technologies on public relations. The development of digital technologies puts on the agenda the issue of the protection of human rights, including the protection of his personal data, privacy, e-reputation. Digital technologies change regulation in areas directly related to economic development, such as intellectual property, the media, software for production and other processes, patents and trademarks. The formation of new institutions of the digital economy, such as e-finance, including cryptocurrency, e-commerce, and online commerce, is also noted.

Firstly, (i) multi fractal methods and Brownian motion Hölder regularity functions were used for the identification of the significant and self-similar attributes in the Finance dataset. The steps are: (a) polynomial functions were applied on the Finance dataset and p _ finance dataset was obtained. (b) exponential functions were applied and e _ Finance dataset was obtained. Secondly, (ii) Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithms ((Feed Forward Back Propagation (FFBP) and Cascade Forward Back Propagation (CFBP)) were applied on both datasets in a and b. Finally, (iii) classification accuracy rates as per the outcomes obtained from the second stage by the ANN algorithms were compared.

Yet fraudulence and business ceasing of Peer-to-Peer Lending Intermediaries (P2P-INTs) occur frequently, making P2P investors facing serious risk. This paper attempts to explore a bridge connecting managerial research with some most advanced natural language processing (NLP) technologies, and examines the risk assessing power of automatic learning text classifiers based on data of hazard status and top management team profile texts of the P2P-INTs. A risk evaluation model named MULTIPLE NLP Integrated Learning Text Classifier (MUN-LETCLA) based on five NLP techniques and meta-learning is proposed. Then risk classification power of the MUN-LETCLA and the single NLP models is assessed. The results show that the proposed model is effective in classifying low-risk and high-risk P2P-INTs. The NLP models can automatically detect the P2P-INTs risk from Top Management Team (TMT) members' working experience, educational background, and TMT composition with a precision level of more than 75%. © 2013 IEEE.","Machine learning; natural language processing (NLP); peer-to-peer (P2P) network lending; risk evaluation; text analysis","Classification (of information); Distributed computer systems; Finance; Human resource management; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Risk assessment; Integrated learning; NAtural language processing; Peer to Peer (P2P) network; Peer-to-peer lending; Risk classification; Risk evaluation; Text analysis; Top management teams; Peer to peer networks",,,,,"Ministry of Education, MOE

They were also used for code breaking. During World War II, Enigma’s code were cracked by machines in UK. Later on, Seymour Roger Cray, an American electrical engineer designed and created the fastest supercomputer named CDC6600 at Control Data Corporation (CDC). The point of having HPC is to allow individual nodes to work together in order to solve a problem larger than any one computer can easily solve. These nodes will need to be able to communicate and pass information from one to another interchangeably via variety of computer network. As long as the nodes are connected to the same network, any tasks can still be solved even when all the computers are not located in the same place. HPC systems are normally used by the government sectors such as military forces and meteorological departments. Meteorological departments would use HPC to undertake weather forecasting, climate modelling as well as earthquake simulations and any other matters that are related to the universe. Whereas for military forces, HPC would allows them to do nuclear research or even weapon development, as a preparation for defending the country. This study to emphasize the relationship between high performance and grid computing, to provide a better insight deeper and clearer understandings with the different characteristics of both from a various angle, and further, to demonstrate how grid computing actually helps to solve different complexity levels of tasks and how is it being utilised in our society. This study also discuss about the future of grid computing for high speed networking by investigate the current state of grid computing technology and examine the future undertaking of grid computing high speed networking. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Autonomous grid computing; e-Finance grid; Grid computing; Healthcare grid; High speed networking",,,,,,,,,"Susanto, H., Almunawar, M.N., (2018) Information Security Management Systems: A Novel Framework and Software as A Tool for Compliance with Information Security Standard, , CRC Press, Boca Raton; Susanto, H., Chen, C.K., (2018) Macromolecules Visualization through Bioinformatics: An Emerging Tool of Informatics, p. 383. , Appl.

Self-adaptive software is increasingly expected to meet strict functional and non-functional requirements in applications from areas as diverse as manufacturing, healthcare and finance. To address this need, we introduce a methodology for the systematic ENgineering of TRUstworthy Self-adaptive sofTware (ENTRUST). ENTRUST uses a combination of (1) design-time and runtime modelling and verification, and (2) industry-adopted assurance processes to develop trustworthy self-adaptive software and assurance cases arguing the suitability of the software for its intended application. To evaluate the effectiveness of our methodology, we present a tool-supported instance of ENTRUST and its use to develop proof-of-concept self-adaptive software for embedded and service-based systems from the oceanic monitoring and e-finance domains, respectively. The experimental results show that ENTRUST can be used to engineer self-adaptive software systems in different application domains and to generate dynamic assurance cases for these systems. © 1976-2012 IEEE.","Assurance cases; Assurance evidence; Self-adaptive software systems; Software engineering methodology","Adaptive systems; Application programs; Computer architecture; Computer control systems; Control systems; Embedded systems; Memory architecture; Monitoring; Verification; Assurance case; assurance evidence; Runtimes; Self-adaptive software systems; Software engineering methodologies; Software systems; Adaptive control systems",,,,,,"TABLE 3 Stochastic Models Supported by the ENTRUST Instance, with Citations of Representative Research That Uses Them in Self-Adaptive Systems",,"Almeida, J., Almeida, V., Ardagna, D., Francalanci, C., Trubian, M., Resource management in the autonomic serviceoriented architecture (2006) Proc.

Design/methodology/approach: An online questionnaire was used to collect the data (n=293), and partial least squares structural equation modeling was employed for data analysis. Four e-finance features (perceived reputation, website quality, e-finance familiarity and situational normality) are introduced with trust acting as a moderator between the users’ satisfaction and continuance intention to use an e-finance platform. Findings: The results find that website quality, familiarity and situational normality can influence perceived ease of use (PEOU) and perceived usefulness (PU). PEOU and PU, together with reputation, are positively associated with confirmation which further leads to satisfaction. The positive effects that satisfaction and trust have on e-finance continuance intention are confirmed, and trust is found to be a significant moderator on the relationship between satisfaction and continuance intention. Practical implications: The findings can be used to guide e-finance providers to improve their platform design and services to retain users. Originality/value: This study combines the theory of trust, Technology Acceptance Model and Expectations Confirmation Theory to investigate the factors that influence the continuance intention in the context of e-finance in China. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Continuance intention; E-finance; Expectations Confirmation Theory; Satisfaction; Technology Acceptance Model; Trust","Least squares approximations; Moderators; Websites; Continuance intentions; E finances; Expectations Confirmation Theory; Satisfaction; Technology acceptance model; Trust; Finance",,,,,,,,"Ahn, T., Ryu, S., Han, I., The impact of web quality and playfulness on user acceptance of online retailing (2007) Information & Management, 44 (3), pp. 263-275; Ahuja, G., Collaboration networks, structural holes, and innovation: a longitudinal study (2000) Administrative Science Quarterly, 45 (3), pp. 425-455; Ajzen, I., Fishbein, M., Attitudes and the attitude-behavior relation: reasoned and automatic processes (2000) European Review of Social Psychology, 11 (1), pp. 1-33; Alalwan, A.A., Dwivedi, Y.K., Rana, N.P., Factors influencing adoption of mobile banking by Jordanian bank customers: extending UTAUT2 with trust (2017) International Journal of Information Management, 37 (3), pp. 99-110; Albers, S., PLS and success factor studies in marketing (2010) Handbook of Partial Least Squares, pp. 409-425. , Esposito Vinzi, V.,(Eds), Springer, Berlin and Heidelberg; Bagozzi, R.P., Yi, Y., Phillips, L.W., Assessing construct validity in organizational research (1991) Administrative Science Quarterly, 36 (3), pp. 421-458; Benbasat, I.I., Barki, H., Quo Vadis TAM?

Recently, the use of electronic forms of payments and financing have been increasing rapidly as the technology such as a smartcard, a biometric, a 2D optical code, and so on, have gained more sophistication with the ubiquitous usage of smartphones. Furthermore, the virtual currency systems such as blockchain crypto-currency are expected to accelerate the use of mobile payment services involving more users who were not early adopters of these smart technologies. This preliminary study investigates the potential user's behaviors in the adoption of the Smart Payment System (SPS).

As non-facing service transactions are expanded, financial institutions provide internet banking service, which customers are using with convenience. Accordingly, the information system market related with finance is anticipated to experience much changes in system setup due to change in business and financial environment, and upgrade or new development is continuously performed. However due to the development of informatized society, hacking and virus attack technics are becoming sophisticated and diversified, and also as the cases of infringement of personal privacy etc. are continuously occurring, much efforts are required to resolve these situations. Especially, the current attack paradigm on electronic financial service is concentrated on the customers using electronic finance, so the need for security system is ever increasing to resolve this situation. However, in pursuit of any effort to resolve such situation by proceeding financial security related project, mostly the time and cost incurred for the project is burdensome. Especially, most of such projects accompany numerous risks, and representatively any change in requirements of customers is exercising so heavy influence as to determine the success of the project. Any change in requirements related to financial security shall be immediately processed, but delay of project often occurs due to poor communication between developer and customer. In this regard, this thesis proposes the system to compose development team based on Agile Methods, to differentiate the role of team members and manage the project period, in case financial security software project is performed while development period and development cost is fixed. Also in order to verify the proposed system, actual project is implemented and comparison is made with the waterfall model which is the traditional development methodology. The result of verification shows effect of reduced number of 8% days required for development saving effect. By the proposed system, it is expected that successful progress of financial security related software project would be possible. In the future, subsequent studies on flexible expandability and systematic management methodology are necessary. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS.","Agile methods; Cloud computing; ICT; Project management; Scrum",,,,,,,,,"King, B., (2010) Bank 2.0: How Customer Behaviour and Technology Will Change the Future of Financial Services, , Marshall Cavendish International Asia Pte Ltd; Puustinen, R., Globalisation and the Nigerian banking industry: Efficiency and legitimacy considerations in the adoption of electronic banking (e-banking) services” (2006) International Journal of Management and Decision Making, 7 (5), pp. 494-507; Yin, Z., Gao, Y., Chen, B., “On Development of Supplementary Criminal analysis System Based on CBR and Ontology”, Computer Application and System Modeling (ICCASM), 2010 International Conference on (2010) Vol., 14, pp. 653-655. , Oct; Browning, D., Kessler, G.C., Bluetooth hacking: A case study (2009) Proceedings of the Conference on Digital Forensics, Security and Law.

The challenges experienced during postgraduate studies have to be identified to establish conducive environments. Objective: The objective of this study was to explore and describe the challenges experienced by postgraduate nursing students enrolled in postgraduate coursework and research programmes at a South African university. Methods: An exploratory, descriptive and qualitative design was used. The study was contextual in nature. Purposive sampling was used. Fifteen honours, master’s and doctoral students participated in the study. Data were analysed through qualitative content analysis and measures to ensure trustworthiness, and ethical implementation of the study were implemented. Results: Three themes with categories were identified, namely personal challenges (i.e. finances, employment, family and accommodation), academic and institutional challenges (i.e. workload and time constraints, contact sessions, subject information and assessment) and research-related challenges (i.e. information literacy, supervisory relationship and supervisory structure and process). Conclusion: Institutional support addressing personal, academic and research-related challenges should be provided to enhance student experiences and completion. © 2018.

Therefore, we develop a taxonomy of FinTech business models following a theoretically grounded and empirically validated approach for identifying and defining underlying business model elements.

This paper proposes a decision support system for credit scoring and lending of the low income earners who are customers of M-Shwari using the hidden Markov model. The model emits the credit scores of the customers, both for the peer groups and the individual customers. The learning and training of the model utilises the customers' socio-demographics, telecommunication characteristics and account activities. The peer groups have higher credit scores and are more attractive to offer credit facilities using M-Shwari when compared to the individual borrowers. © 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Electronic finance; Hidden Markov model; HMM; individual; Low-income earners; M-Shwari; Micro-credit lending; Peer group",,,,,,,,,"Ahlin, C., Jiang, N., Can micro-credit bring development?

In this paper, we discuss the following question: To what extent can biometric designs be characterized as Privacy Enhancing Technologies? The terms of privacy and security for biometric schemes are defined, while current regulations for the protection of biometric information are presented. Additionally, we analyze and compare cryptographic techniques for secure biometric designs. Finally, we introduce a privacy-preserving approach for biometric authentication in mobile electronic financial applications. Our model utilizes the mechanism of pseudonymous biometric identities for secure user registration and authentication. We discuss how the privacy requirements for the processing of biometric data can be met in our scenario.

In this work, the asymptotic distribution for the difference of two independent ARMA coefficients is established. The presented method can be used to derive the asymptotic confidence set for the difference of coefficients and hypothesis testing for the equality of two time series. Then the Monte Carlo simulation study is provided to investigate the performance of proposed method. The performance of the new method is comparable with alternative method. © 2017, Shiraz University.","ARMA processes; Asymptotic; Simulation; Simultaneous inference; Time series",,,,,,,,,"Brockwell, P.J., Davis, R.A., (1991) Time series: theory and methods, , Springer, Berlin; Caiado, J., Crato, N., Pena, D., A periodogram-based metric for time series classification (2006) Comput Stat Data Anal, 50, pp. 2668-2684; Camacho, M., Perez-Quiroz, G., Saiz, L., (2004) Are European business cycles close enough to be just one?

This evolution is characterized by expanded connectivity and enhanced speed of information processing both at the customer interface and in back-office processes. Recently, there has been a shift in the focus of digitalization from improving the delivery of traditional tasks to introducing fundamentally new business opportunities and models for financial service companies. Digital Finance encompasses a magnitude of new financial products, financial businesses, finance-related software, and novel forms of customer communication and interaction—delivered by FinTech companies and innovative financial service providers. Against this backdrop, the research on finance and information systems has started to analyze these changes and the impact of digital progress on the financial sector. Therefore, this article reviews the current state of research in Digital Finance that deals with these novel and innovative business functions. Moreover, it gives an outlook on potential future research directions. As a conceptual basis for reviewing this field, the Digital Finance Cube, which embraces three key dimensions of Digital Finance and FinTech, i.e., the respective business functions, the technologies and technological concepts applied as well as the institutions concerned, is introduced. This conceptualization supports researchers and practitioners when orientating in the field of Digital Finance, allows for the arrangement of academic research relatively to each other, and enables for the revelation of the gaps in research. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Digital Finance; e-Finance; FinTech; Future research opportunities; Literature review; State of the art",,,,,,,,,"Agrawal, A., Catalini, C., Goldfarb, A., Crowdfunding: geography, social networks, and the timing of investment decision (2015) J Econ Manag Strat, 24 (2), pp. 253-274; Ahlers, G.K., Cumming, D., Günther, C., Schweizer, D., Signaling in equity crowdfunding (2015) Entrep Theory Pract, 39 (4), pp. 955-980; Allen, F., McAndrews, J., Strahan, P., E-Finance: an introduction (2002) J Financ Serv Res, 22 (1), pp. 5-27; Allison, T.H., Davis, B.C., Short, J.C., Webb, J.W., Crowdfunding in a prosocial microlending environment: examining the role of intrinsic versus extrinsic cues (2015) Entrep Theory Pract, 39 (1), pp. 53-73; Amit, R., Zott, C., Crafting business architecture: the antecedents of business model design (2015) Strat Entrep J, 9 (4), pp. 331-350; Androutsellis-Theotokis, S., Spinellis, D., A survey of peer-to-peer content distribution technologies (2004) ACM Comput Surv, 36 (4), pp. 335-371; Antweiler, W., Frank, M.Z., Is all that talk just noise?

Access to finance can be facilitated by ICT and e-finance, which can reduce the cost of financial services and increase access to international markets. However, in spite of the potential benefits of e-finance, developing countries have been reported to be lagging behind in terms of e-finance adoption as compared with developed nations. The reason for non-adoption could be due to barriers such as lack of ICT infrastructure, data privacy and security concerns. The purpose of this chapter is to investigate the extent of understanding and adoption of e-finance by SMEs. A survey of SMEs in two developing countries, South Africa and Bangladesh, was conducted. The results of the survey revealed that access to financial products and services was the highest rated benefit of e-finance to respondent SMEs, whereas regulatory environment and policy was the highest rated barrier. © 2017, IGI Global.

Design/methodology/approach: It is an exhaustive review of technical developments and corporate practices in the area of electronic finance. Findings: Electronic finance is a dominating force changing business models and systems in financial services. New developments are creating newer valuation metrics, and reinforcing the costs and benefits of security systems. Research limitations/implications: This review concludes by pointing out potential areas of advancement in the coming decades and the possible evolution of newer e-finance models based on developments in artificial intelligence (AI) and internet of things (IoT) and its implications for managerial finance. Originality/value: This is a review of the impact of electronic finance over the past two decades. Looking back electronic finance has significantly transformed the activities of corporations. Looking forward, financial managers have to watch for two important technical developments of AI and IoT and its potential impact on finance. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Banking industry; Business performance; Computer security; Financial institutions; Strategic planning",,,,,,,,,"Austin, S., Canipe, C., Slobin, S., (2015) The billion-dollar startup club, , February 18, 2015, :, (accessed; (2015) Unicorn power law: the top 10 unicorns are worth more than the next 70 combined, , www.cbinsights.com/blog/unicorn-power-law/, June 23, 2015, :, (accessed; Chanjaroen, C., Boey, D., (2016) Fraud in $4 trillion trade finance has banks turning digital, , www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-22/fraud-in-4-trillion-trade-finance-turns-banks-to-digital-ledger, May 22, 2016, :, (accessed; Damodaran, A., (2006) Damodaran on Valuation 2nd Edition: Security Analysis for Investment and Corporate Finance, , John Wiley & Sons, New York, NY; (2013), www2.deloitte.com/global/en/pages/financial-services/articles/quantum-dawn-2.html, December 15, 2014, :, (accessed; Eckenrode, J., (2015) The internet of things in the financial services industry, , http://dupress.com/articles/internet-of-things-iot-in-financial-services-industry/, October 13, 2015, :, (accessed; (2014) Bitcoin: more than a bit risky, , www.finra.org/investors/protectyourself/investoralerts/fraudsandscams/p45, March 13, 2014, :, (accessed; Goodwin, T., (2015) Are we struggling to value unicorns?, , http://techcrunch.com/2015/10/21/are-we-struggling-to-value-unicorns/, December 15, 2015, :, (accessed; Gordon, M.J., Dividends, earnings and stock prices (1959) Review of Economics and Statistics, 41 (2), pp. 99-105; Granville, K., (2015) 9 recent cyberattacks against big businesses, , www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/02/05/technology/recent-cyberattacks.html?_r=0, December 15, 2015, New York Times, Technology Section, February 5, p. 1, :, (accessed; Haigu, A., Beach, N., (2014) Bitcoin: the future of digital payments?, , Harvard Business School Case Study 714-519, June; Henwood, D., The Bitcoin fantasy (2014) Nation, 298 (20), pp. 12-17; Huang, D., Glazer, E., Yadron, D., (2014) Financial firms bolster cybersecurity budgets, , www.wsj.com/articles/financial-firms-bolster-cybersecurity-budgets-1416182536, December 14, 2014, The Wall Street Journal, November 17, :, (accessed; Ly, M.K., Coining Bitcoin’s ‘legal-bits’: examining the regulatory framework for Bitcoin and virtual currencies (2014) Harvard Journal of Law & Technology, 27 (2), pp. 587-608; McAfee, A., (2011) What every CEO needs to know about the cloud, pp. 124-132. , Harvard Business Review, November; (2016) Artificial intelligence (AI) – global forecast to 2020, , www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/artificial-intelligence-market-74851580.html?gclid=CLDyxMHJkc0CFdgLgQodGYYGPw, December 15, 2016, Report Code: SE 4053, November, :, (accessed; Mercado, J., (2013) D & O liability in data privacy and cyber security situations in Latin America, , www.financierworldwide.com/do-liability-in-data-privacy-and-cyber-security-situations-in-latin-america/#.V1Si_ZErJdg, December 11, 2014, :, (accessed; Nakamoto, S., (2008) Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System, , https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf, December 14, 2014, :, (accessed; Entangling the atoms in an optical lattice for quantum computation (2014) Quantum Physics, , www.phys.org, December 15, 2015, March 17, :, (accessed; Shackelford, S.J., Should your firm invest in cyber risk insurance?

To address these challenges, most are turning their attention to e-health as the panacea. Indeed, it is true that in today’s global and networked world, e-health should be the answer for ensuring pertinent information, relevant data, and germane knowledge anywhere anytime so that clinicians can deliver superior healthcare. Sadly, healthcare has yet to realize the full potential of e-health, which is in stark contrast to other e-business initiatives such as e-government and e-education, e-finance, or e-commerce.

As users can access pages on the Web directly, Web application plays a vital role in various domains such as e-finance and public-services. Inevitably, it will be followed by unprecedented amount of attacks and exploitations. Amongst all of those attacks, SQL injection attacks have consistently high rank in last years due to corresponding vulnerabilities. It is crucial to checking this vulnerabilities before web services being public. In our paper we present an effective approach for testing, MOSA, and mutation operators set to its underpinning. Using this approach we can produce test inputs that cause executable and malignant SQL statement efficiently. Besides that, we do numerous experiments and the results demonstrate that the mutation approach can detect SQL injection vulnerabilities and generate inputs that bypass web application firewalls. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Mutation operators; Test generation; Vulnerability","Cloud computing; Computer crime; Network security; Websites; Effective approaches; Mutation operators; Public services; Sql injection attacks; Test generations; Vulnerability; WEB application; Web application firewalls; Web services",,,,,"Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin City: 16JCYBJC15500

So it is very important to improve the usability of the product by combining the features and attributes known to benefit the user in the context of its use. This study aims to measure the level of usability of e-government website based on four aspects: effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction (ISO 9241-11) and ease of use (SUS), so it can be the assessment of each aspect of are used to improve the system. The standard questionnaire used is UMUX (Usability Metric for User Experience), which consists of 4 item Likert scale (1-7). Furthermore, the results of this study can be used as a base to explore the problem of what happens when users use e-government.

The paper discusses four cases at different scales (local, subnational, regional and global) to highlight opportunities for introducing principles of energy justice into the core of business models of companies. By doing so, the paper offers a critical perspective on the potential of business model innovation to be guided through a more broadly defined understanding of value enhanced by concepts of energy justice. The discussion of the four case studies—the Carbon Cooperative, Robin Hood Energy, RenEsco, and the Yansa Community Interest Company—highlights the importance of creating supportive wider environments for social and business model innovations, such as the development of skills, knowledge and social capital, through interventions coming from multiple levels and focused on different aspects of energy generation, supply and use (i.e. finance and technical implementation). Going against the grain of current policy, the study implies a shift away from upscaling innovations by taking them to the national scale, and towards creating supportive conditions for more local deals in different geographic locations. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Business models; Energy justice; Social innovation; Value; Whole system","Carbon; Decision making; Business models; Energy justices; Social innovations; Value; Whole system; Innovation; cost-benefit analysis; decision making; energy policy; energy use; innovation; knowledge; management practice; social capital",,,,,,,,"Amit, R., Zott, C., Value creation in e-business (2001) Strateg.

Its e-payment system, Alipay, has transactions three times that of PayPal and accounted for one-third of the global online payments in 2015. Alipay and its competitors in China have quickly developed their e-payment systems into comprehensive internet banks to allow users to make on-line payments, transfer money to other internet accounts, pay utility bills, buy train tickets, check bank balances, shop in supermarkets, earn high interest rates for surplus balance, and obtain loans and other financial services. This rapid development left the Chinese legislative systems on internet-banking far behind regulation. E-commerce providers in China are regulated by the telecom sector rather than the financial sector. The ""telecom"" status has given the e-commerce firms great leeway to develop their e-finance systems rapidly without much consideration for data security and privacy and the prevention of money laundry. Risk reduction and data security enhancement have been significantly developed in China. An instant lock system for mobile payment users has been used to lock an e-payment account when its mobile phone is lost. Money tracking software can also track the route of money transfers, ranges, and frequency from the users. Users can utilize real-time information to verify the authenticity of information and freeze unknown users. China's central bank has introduced multiple verifications that prohibit fund transfers among users and cap daily payments to prevent money laundering. However, efinance user authentication requirements need further enhancement. For example, the adopted fingerprint or facial recognition technology may provide lifetime problems for users. Protecting Chinese citizens' private data is difficult because no legislative definition of personal information exists. No national-level legislation exists to protect or define personal data. Internet finance is a significant step in the financial reform of China as well as the rest of the world. Strengthening security issues may impose more constraints or hinder development. China is sufficiently prepared to reduce the risks, but security and protection issues continue to fall behind. Joint efforts from all parties and nations concerned are required to reduce the risks of this rapidly expanding global business.","China; Data security and privacy; Internet finance; Money laundering","Authentication; Cellular telephone systems; Computer crime; Data privacy; Electronic money; Face recognition; Finance; Global system for mobile communications; Laundering; Laws and legislation; Locks (fasteners); China; Data security and privacy; Money laundering; Personal information; Real-time information; Security and protection; Security enhancements; User authentication; Data reduction",,,,,,,,"Backaler, J., China's e-commerce makes global waves (2015) China Daily, , Asia; Bani-Hani, R.M., Wahsheh, Y.A., Al-Sarhan, M.B., Secure QR code system (2014) 10th International Conference on Innovations in Information Technology (INNOVATIONS), pp. 1-6. , IEEE; Bigg, C., China: Significant changes to data and cybersecurity practices under PRC Cybersecurity Law (2016) DLA PIPER's Global Privacy and Data Protection Resource; (2015) China E-Commerce Research Center Report, , CECRC(2015); (2016) China Internet Watch Report, , CIW.

New market entrants such as Apple, Alibaba, Facebook and Google come from industries such as IT, retail, social media and telecoms, and, therefore, do not fit comfortably within traditional financial institutional structures. A functional perspective might provide more practical insights into this revolution; however, the functional perspective has had a limited impact. This paper will investigate the benefits and limitations of financial functional analysis; probe the underpinning principles of sociology’s structural functional analysis; revisit Merton and Bodie’s (1995) six core financial functions in relation to new entrants in the financial landscape; and, finally, argue that in the new financial environment, functional analysis provides a more coherent and explanatory framework of the financial system for students and practitioners alike. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","financial functional analysis; financial system; functional and structural finance; functional structuralism",,,,,,,,,"Abrahamson, M., (1978) Functionalism, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall; Abrams, R.K., Taylor, M.W., (2000) Issues in the unification of financial sector supervision 22(International Monetary Fund Working Paper No. WP/00/213), , Washington, DC: International Monetary Fund; Akerlof, G., Shiller, R., (2015) Phishing for phools: The economics of manipulation and deception, , Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press; Awrey, D., The FSA, integrated regulation and the curious case of OTC derivatives (July 20, 2010) (2010) University of Pennsylvania Journal of Business Law, 13, p. 1. , https://www.law.upenn.edu/journals/jbl/articles/volume13/issue1/Awrey13U.Pa.J.Bus.L.1%282010%29.pdf, Oxford Legal Studies Research Paper No. 61/2010; Bain, J.S., (1959) Industrial organisation, , New York, NY: John Wiley and Sons; (2008) BIS quarterly review, , Basel: Author; Banks, E., (2001) e-Finance: The electronic revolution in financial services, , New York, NY: Wiley; Black, F., The future of financial services (1985) Managing the service economy, pp. 222-230. , Inman R.P., (ed), Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, Chapter 8; Bodie, Z., Merton, R.C., (1992) Pension reform and privatisation in international perspective: The case of Israel, , Harvard Business School Working Paper No. 92-082, Boston, MA:; Bodie, Z., Merton, R.C., Pension benefit guarantees in the United States: A functional analysis (1993) The future of pensions in the United States, pp. 194-246. , Schmidt R., (ed), Philadelphia, PA: Pension Research Council, Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania Press; Bodie, Z., Merton, R.C., The information role of asset prices (1995) The global financial system, a functional perspective, pp. 197-224. , Crane D.B., Froot K.A., Mason S.P., Perold A., Merton R.C., Bodie Z., Tufano P., (eds), Boston, MA: Harvard Business School Press; Bourricaud, F., (1981) The sociology of Talcott Parsons, , Chicago, IL: Chicago University Press; Chami, R., Fullenkamp, C., Sharma, S., (2009) A framework for financial market development(IMF Working Paper WP/09/156), , Washington, DC: IMF Institute; Coval, J.D., Thakor, A.V., Financial intermediation as a beliefs-bridge between optimists and pessimists (2005) Journal of Financial Economics, 75, pp. 535-569; Cramer, K.M., Six criteria of a viable theory: Putting reversal theory to the test (2013) Journal of Motivation, Emotion, and Personality, 1, pp. 9-16; Crane, D.B., The transfer of economic resources (1995) The global financial system, a functional perspective, pp. 129-151. , Crane D.B., Froot K.A., Mason S.P., Perold A., Merton R.C., Bodie Z., Tufano P., (eds), Boston, MA: Harvard Business School Press; Crane, D.B., Froot, K.A., Mason, S.P., André Perold, A., Merton, R.C., Bodie, Z., Tufano, P., (1995) The global financial system, a functional perspective, , Boston, MA: Harvard Business School Press; Christensen, C.M., (1997) The innovators dilemma: When new technologies cause great firms to fail, , Boston, MA: Harvard Business School Press; Cummins, R., Functional analysis (1975) The Journal of Philosophy, 72, pp. 741-765; Davis, E.P., (2000) Pension funds, financial intermediation and the new financial landscape, , http://www.pensions-institute.org/workingpapers/wp0010.pdf, The Pensions Institute, Cass Business School Discussion Paper PI-0010; Durkheim, E., (1982) The rules of sociological method, , New York, NY: Free Press; Easley, D., O’Hara, M., Information and the cost of capital (2004) The Journal of Finance, 59, pp. 1553-1583; Fama, E.F., Efficient capital markets: A review of theory and empirical work (1970) The Journal of Finance, 25, pp. 383-417; (2012) Journey to the FCA, , London: Author; Fohlin, C., Financial systems and economic development in historical perspective (2015) Handbook of cliometrics, pp. 393-430. , Diebolt C., Haupert M., (eds), Heidelberg: Springer-Verlag; Gilbert, E.W., Scott, W.L., The Financial Modernization Act: New perspectives for the finance curriculum (2001) Financial Services Review, 10, pp. 197-208; Giovannini, A., (2010) Financial system reform proposals from first principles(Policy Insight No. 45), , http://dev3.cepr.org/pubs/PolicyInsights/PolicyInsight45.pdf, London: Centre for Economic Policy Research; Goetzmann, W.N., Rouwenhorst, K.G., (2005) The origins of value.

The representation provides information, calculations, and recommendations based on the outcome of modeling in order to guide enterprises on the alternatives or actions to perform. In the advent of computer technology financial modeling has evolved from simple formulary calculations to complex computer programs which can process large volumes of information. The goal of this research study was to analyse different types of financial modeling, the impact of computer technology in financial modeling, and the effectiveness of e-finance financial modeling to enterprises including security issues. The research contributed in understanding E-Finance financial modeling, identifying factors impeding its successful adoption, and recommended strategies as well as areas that need further research to successfully improve the adoption of such innovations. The research depended on peer reviewed papers in the field of financial modeling to provide available empiric evidence as well as explore the basis of different financial models to come up with valid and reliable data. The findings show that firms are rapidly adopting e-finance financial modeling because they find it to be effective although they have to spend a lot of funds in employing financial modeling experts, installing programs or softwares, and maintaining softwares against online risks. Computer technology has enabled large volumes of information to be analysed within a short time although the cost factor a challenge and softwares have to be protected against malwares. The research found that several financial models exist, but the choice of one depends on the needs of an enterprise. However, the field of e-finance financial modeling needs further research to update the available financial models to cope up with the current constantly changing financial dynamics of firms. © 2015 IEEE.","computer technology; e-finance; enterprise; modeling; program; software","Artificial intelligence; Computer software; Industry; Models; Computer technology; E finances; Financial dynamics; Financial modeling; Financial models; program; Research studies; Security issues; Finance",,,,,,,,"Allen, F., McAndrews, J., Strahan, P., E-finance: An introduction (2002) J.

In this, it is very similar to optimizing a portfolio of financial assets in regard of return and risk. This article draws the analogy between these two mostly different scientific worlds, i.e. finance and engineering. Similarities and differences in context of weighted-mean data fusion based on numerical traffic flow measurements such as travel times or speeds are discussed. This, in particular, includes guessing the potential benefit of negative weights. Optimal weights are derived following a strict mathematical theory based on assumptions (parameters) about systematic bias and correlations of the considered data sources. Moreover, a specific way of reducing the systematic bias of the fusion results is proposed and compared to common methods. The whole approach is demonstrated based on position data from two independent vehicle fleets in Athens, Greece. In this context, the problem of parameter calibration is solved by applying an advanced tool for such floating car data systems, called ""self-evaluation"". The experiments show that the proposed methods reliably reduce the systematic bias and variance of the fusion results with regard to the original data as well as in comparison to the naïve fusion approach that uses equal weights for all data sources. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","data fusion; linear model; systematic bias; travel time; variance; weighted mean","Finance; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Traffic control; Travel time; Linear modeling; Mathematical theory; Parameter calibration; Potential benefits; Systematic bias; Traffic flow measurement; Variance; Weighted mean; Data fusion",,,,,,,,"El Faouzi, N.E., Leung, H., Kurian, A., Data fusion in intelligent transportation systems: Progress and challenges - A survey (2011) Information Fusion, 12, pp. 4-10; Hu, J., Kaparias, I., Bell, M.G.H., Current state and future outlook of traffic data fusion in London (2012) Proceedings 15th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC), pp. 1483-1488; El Faouzi, N.E., Data fusion in road traffic engineering: An overview (2004) Multisensor, Multisource Information Fusion: Architectures, Algorithms, and Applications, pp. 360-371; Llinas, J., Liggings, M.E., Hall, D.L., (2008) Handbook of Multisensor Data Fusion: Theory and Practice, , Taylor & Francis: Boca Raton, FL; (2003) Hinweise Zur Datenvervollständigung und Datenaufbereitung in Verkehrstechnischen Anwendungen, , Forschungsgesellschaft für Straßen - und Verkehrswesen (FGSV).

An incrementally modular abstraction hierarchy, IMAH in short, is used in 7 layers starting from homotopy, then type, and ending with presentation. Big data is in cyber worlds that are being formed in cyberspaces as computational spaces. Now cyberspaces are rapidly expanding on the Web either intentionally or spontaneously, with or without design. It is quite different in its emphasis of homotopy type theory as recently reported with emphasis on mathematical proof automation and computer verification. Widespread and intensive local activities are melting each other on the web as big data globally to create cyber worlds. The major key players of big data in cyber worlds include e-finance that trades a GDP-equivalent a day and e-manufacturing that is transforming industrial production into Web shopping of product components and assembly factories. Lacking proper theory and design, big data has continued to grow chaotic and are now out of human understanding and control. This research first presents a generic theoretical framework as an incrementally modular abstraction hierarchy, based on homotopy type theory, provides an axiomatic approach to theorize the potentials of big data in cyber worlds, and shows that the incrementally modular abstraction hierarchy automate big data application development and eliminates the need for design verification and validation. It also makes the systems developed secure from the all sort of attacks. © 2015 IEEE.","big data; homotopy type theory; incrementally modular abstraction hierarch","Abstracting; Computation theory; Computers; Formal languages; Metadata; Big data applications; Combinatorial explosion; Computer verification; Homotopy types; incrementally modular abstraction hierarch; Incrementally modular abstraction hierarchy; Industrial production; Theoretical framework; Big data",,,,,,,,"Kunii, T.L., (1998) The Philosophy of Synthetic Worlds-Digital Genesis for Communicating Synthetic Worlds and the Real World, pp. 5-15. , Cyberworlds, T.

To develop a conceptual model for the P2P lending process is great valuable for managers to tack the issues of marketing, management and operation. Methods: In this paper, we focus on the P2P lending process model and provide a comparative analysis comparing with traditional bank loan process. Results: Firstly, our model shows that the information flow in P2P lending is more frequent and transparent. Secondly, the model reveals that P2P lending uses a quite different credit audition method, which relies on information and the decision model in the P2P systems. Thirdly, the loan management is not complete normally in P2P lending, because most P2P companies do not have the post-loan records of borrowers. Conclusions: These findings inspire future studies and practices on P2P lending process and key technologies. © 2015, Wang et al.;licensee Springer.","E-finance; P2P landing; Process model",,,,,,,"The work described in this paper was partially supported by a grant from the Shenzhen Municipal Science and Technology R&D Funding—Basic Research Program (Project No. JCYJ20140417105742712).",,"Berger, S.C., Gleisner, F., Emergence of financial intermediaries in electronic markets: the case of online P2P lending (2009) BuR-Bus Res J, 2 (1), pp. 39-65; Chen, D., Han, C., A comparative study of online P2P lending in the USA and China (2012) J Internet Banking Commerce J, 17 (2), pp. 1-15; Duarte, J., Siegel, S., Young, L., Trust and credit: the role of appearance in peer-to-peer lending (2012) Rev Financ Stud J, 25 (8), pp. 2455-2484; Greiner, M.E., Wang, H., Building consumer-to-consumer trust in e-finance marketplaces: an empirical analysis (2010) Int J Electron Commerce J, 15 (2), pp. 105-136; Herrero-Lopez, S., Social interactions in P2P lending (2009) Proceedings of the 3Rd Workshop on Social Network Mining and Analysis, , ACM, New York, NY, USA; Kiisel, T., Peer-to-peer loans (2013) Getting a business loan, pp. 129-138. , (,),.

However, it is almost impossible to do this because of the cost problem. In this paper, we sorted the system by its character such as the data and investment size. This sorting can be used as a standard for adapting IT security review. Though it is necessary to review the security functions and requirement from the analysis · design level, this process is ignored in most of the system development. In the important system, this security review has been compulsory in Korean finance. Especially Financial supervisory service in Korea announced that all of financial companies have to review the IT security task whenever they do the IT system development on the base of compliance named 'Electronic finance supervisory rule'. Is it necessary to adapt the strong review process in every IT system? In this paper, we show this standard. For this, we sorted the IT system in 4 models and made the review process. This standard can play a role in deciding whether the very system development should get the strong security review or not. This trial is expected to help other financial companies make decisions whether the process of IT security review should be strong or not. This can save the cost by adapting the strong security review only in the important system development. © 2015 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

The cash economy had the unintended consequence of excluding a large portion of the population from financial services, particularly banking services. This shift is significant for the economy because it has enabled the informal sector to tap into banking services. The Zimbabwean informal sector has gradually emerged as a major employer owing to economic challenges that have shrunk the formal sector. This reality has motivated mobile telephony companies to introduce innovative financial products targeting this sector. In this paper we use the SWOT framework to analyse the mobile banking sector in Zimbabwe. Our investigation seeks to inform stakeholders about the sector's potential and to caution about weaknesses that impact on stability and growth. We also characterise the processes involved in mobile banking to enable easy comparison of offerings from different service providers.

More attention is paid to provide traditional banking services in novel ways, offering free tools for planning budgets, testing financial investments, and consultations, etc. The research focuses on valuation of e-finance innovations occurrence through measures for knowledge inflows, testing whether and how social activities (education programs, open seminars, consultations, public comments, contests, games, platforms) and participation in networks allow to involve potential innovators and create advanced e-finance services. The emergence of social activities, especially by banks, is numerous; banks show more interest not only in separate projects, but in social networks as well. The research results indicate that involvement of banks into social activities is mostly related to reaching the aim of ensuring awareness and trust by current or potential customers and only partly of searching for opportunities to cooperate for innovations.

The study investigates three post-adoption behavioural consequences - namely, trust, satisfaction and word of mouth. Using purposeful sampling techniques, we found that trust plays a significant role in promoting continuous usage of m-banking. In general, the respondents reported high levels of trust in m-banking technology and were satisfied with the m-banking application and services. In addition, convenience, user friendliness and speed emerged as the main sub-topics related to satisfaction. In most cases, the convenience of using m-banking dominated the recommendation criteria. However, users, especially those in ZA, generally do not promote m-banking services to others. This study shows that for the majority of users, m-banking usage is related to increased satisfaction with the bank, implying that m-banking services should be a vital part of banks' strategy to retain customers.

In recent years, mobile banking service applications have been on the increase along with the trend of mobile internet, and customer demand for using mobile financial services is growing in great leaps. The mobile financial services provided by mobile financial platforms should be in line with the real needs of the users, and the service contents should be different for different user groups. According to the findings of this study, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and service quality had a positive impact on user attitude and intention to use mobile financial services. The electronic finance industry should optimise the transaction processes, ensure transaction security and help users to quickly complete mobile financial transactions to improve the efficiency and performance.

A survey was conducted among undergraduate and graduate mobile banking users in a regional university. Logistic regression procedures were deployed to analyse valid data points. The study found that among well-educated mobile banking users, user personal innovativeness as measured by PIIT and perceived usefulness, the determinants of initial adoption, remain as strong determinants of user continuance intention. PIIT also remains as the antecedent of perceived ease of use. Social influence has changed the pattern of influence on mobile banking continuance intention.

Contactless payments are electronic payments using radio-frequency identification (RFID) or near field communication (NFC) provided by various devices at point-of-sale terminal with contactless payments allowed. The most providers indicate contactless transactions being approximately twice as fast as cash or standard payments by credit or debit card. Multiple studies worldwide investigate the acceptance of various electronic banking technologies among customers based on various factors and attributes. The most of the studies investigate consumer acceptance of any electronic banking technology by using of the Technology Acceptance Model. This study uses technology acceptance model with adjustments for investigation of the contactless payments acceptance in conditions of Slovak market. The data for model testing was gathered by questionnaire survey conducted among potential Slovak contactless payments users. The hypotheses based on the developed of model were tested using the factor analysis of gathered data. The results of analysis indicated positive effect of perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and perceived security on consumer acceptance of contactless payments. The amount of information about contactless payments and perceived enjoyment were not identified as statistically significant factors of contactless payments acceptance. © 2015, ASERS Publishing House.

It must optimize its use of resources and delivery of current services. It must employ innovation to develop new opportunities and services. The key will be to leverage its infrastructure and build on its strong community linkage, while taking advantages of emerging trends in information and communication technology. This study uses information gathered from the postal systems in Africa and other less developed settings. It also draws on postal expansion options identified by the Universal Postal Union (UPU) in the areas of e-post, e-commerce, e-government and e-finance, as a basis for a framework orientated to community service in southern Africa. This framework is designed to facilitate the development of a more effective postal research strategy that is well integrated into the overall business strategy of the post office, building on existing services and incorporating new e-postal services. This overall process should encourage regional and continental integration of postal services and foster citizen and community empowerment. © 2015 African Journal of Science.

It presents, in casually-consecutive way, the targets of company and their measurers. Modelling after the strategic scorecard utilized with regard of entire company, the similar card for projecting and evaluating the results of companies integration, was proposed. Company integration, especially mergers and takeovers are the investment projects and concern, as a whole, one strategic target i.e. the company development. Within that activity, in order to study the results of companies integration, the areas (perspectives) covering the problems of effectiveness, resources, products and market as well as competences, were proposed. From the perspective of effectiveness the basic targetmeasurer is the increase of parent-company’s value but also static and dynamic measurers are used. Among the standard static measures are profitability ratios, while among dynamic ones the net present value (NPV). From resource perspective, the integration targets are sought in mining-geological assets, especially in deposits exploration, prospection and mining concessions (royalties). Essential dimensions of evaluation are positioned within the macroeconomic and microeconomic location and geological and mining estimation. From the product-market perspective, the integration targets are located within the product area and consists in increasing the production volume, improving its usefulness including quality features and new products related with activity diversification. Targets in the market area concern the increase of clients database, whereat the sectorial or portfolio analyses are used respectively. Competence perspective includes many areas building the general organizational knowledge of the company involving individual mastership, experience and problems solving competence. The activities which cannot be made by company itself are contracted outside. It was pointed out that one of the basic targets of companies integration is widening their competence range. © Instytut Gospodarki Surowcami Mineralnymi i Energia Polskiej Akademii Nauk 2013.","Company value; Competences development; Deposit value; Integration of mining companies; Strategic scorecard",,,,,,,,,"Ansoff, H.J., Corporate Strategy (1965) Analytic Approach to Business Policy for Growth and Expansion, , New York: McGraw-Hill Book Co; Borucki, W.I., Urbaniak, M., Zdefiniowaæ jakooeść (1996) Problemy Jakooeci Nr, p. 12; Buckley, A., Inwestycje zagraniczne – skɫadniki wartooeci i ocena (2002) Warszawa: PWN; Butra, J., Kicki, J., Kudeɫko, J., Wanielista, K.I., Wirth, H., (2010), Butra i in. 2010, Strategia zarządzania przedsiêbiorstwami górniczymi w ujêciu modelowym.

To address these challenges, most are turning their attention to e-health as the panacea. Indeed, it is true that in today's global and networked world, e-health should be the answer for ensuring pertinent information, relevant data, and germane knowledge anywhere anytime so that clinicians can deliver superior healthcare. Sadly, healthcare has yet to realize the full potential of e-health, which is in stark contrast to other e-business initiatives such as e-government and e-education, e-finance, or e-commerce. This chapter asserts that it is only by embracing a rich theoretical lens of analysis that the full potential of e-health can be harnessed, and thus, it proffers Actor-Network Theory (ANT) as such a lens. © 2014 by IGI Global.

Initialized by groups in online social networks, a commercial online P2P E-finance Platform has been designed in Guangzhou, China. Thus online P2P E-finance Platform is a relatively young research field. P2P network lending platform is a business model, which combines the internet and financing together, pooling the small amount of funds to lend to who needs them. The lending process can achieve through the platform, such as the information and funds, contracts, procedures.

Then, the paper gives a brief overview of design of the peer-to-peer E-finance Platform, structures, outlines of the framework for platform modules and determinants of P2P E-finance.

This paper aims to build up a theoretical framework from the perspectives of informational social influence and herding behavior to explain how individual investors' participation of online financial community influence their credit risk preference in online P2P lending marketplaces under different financial situations. The research proposes that online financial community participants' credit risk preference is higher than non-participants in investment decision making during non-financial crisis period, whereas online financial community participants' credit risk preference is lower than non-participants during financial crisis period. This research plans to conduct a field study to test the proposed effect by examining individual investors' real transaction data on Prosper.com during financial crisis period and non-financial crisis period as well as their membership records on the community of Prospers.org. An analytical model will be further estimated to test the proposition.","Credit risk preference; E-finance; Financial crisis; Financial situation; Individual investment; Non-financial crisis; Online financial community; Online P2P lending marketplace; P2P lending","Commerce; Decision making; Investments; Risk assessment; Social networking (online); Credit risks; E finances; Financial community; Financial crisis; Financial situation; P2p lending; Finance",,,,,,,,"Algesheimer, R., Dholakia, U.M., Herrmann, A., The social influence of brand community: Evidence from european car clubs (2005) Journal of Marketing, 69, pp. 19-34. , July; Aronson, E., Wilson, T.D., Akert, A.M., (2005) Social Psychology, , 5th ed).

Information systems have often been applied to support investors by forecasting price changes in securities markets. In addition to the asset price, liquidity represents another financial variable that has a high relevance for investors because it constitutes a main determinant of total transaction costs. Previous research has shown that the level of liquidity is affected by the publication of corporate disclosures. To derive an optimal order execution strategy that minimises the transaction costs, investors as well as automated trading engines must be able to anticipate changes in the available market liquidity. However, there is no research on how to forecast the impact of corporate disclosures on market liquidity. Therefore, we propose an IT artefact that allows automated trading engines to appropriately react to news-related liquidity shocks. The system indicates whether the publication of a regulatory corporate disclosure will be followed by a positive liquidity shock, i.e.; lower transaction costs compared to historical levels. Utilising text mining techniques, the content of the corporate disclosures is analysed to generate a trading signal. Furthermore, the trading signal is evaluated within a simulation-based use case that considers English and German corporate disclosures and is shown to be of economic value. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Automated trading; e-Finance; Forecasting; Liquidity; Simulation; Text mining","Automation; Costs; Data mining; Engines; Forecasting; Investments; Signal processing; Automated trading; E finances; Liquidity; Simulation; Text mining; Commerce",,,,,,,,"Bikker, J., Spierdijk, L., Hoevenaars, R., Van Der Sluis, P.J., Forecasting market impact costs and identifying expensive trades (2006) Journal of Forecasting, 27 (1), pp. 21-39; Bissantz, N., Hagedorn, J., (2009) Data Mining, Business & Information Systems Engineering, 1 (1), pp. 118-122; Braschler, M., Ripplinger, B., How effective is stemming and decompounding for German text retrieval?

Prior research has examined internet banking adoption as a classification problem with a focus on adopters and non-adopters using traditional statistical approaches. In this paper we extend the problem by including partial adopters and used decision tree induction as the analytical method. Our results on data from customers in 20 countries show that household income is the most important variable in separating those who do not adopt IB or partially adopt IB from those who fully do. Education and age are the most important variables in separating partial adopters from non-adopters. While exploratory, our results provide opportunities for further theory development on internet banking adoption while practically contributing to discussions on how practitioners can develop specific strategies to targeted customers to become fully adopters of online banking services.

Based on 1980-2010 annual time series data, by using co-integration and the Granger Causality test, and adopting financial scale expansion, i.e. finance-related ratio indicators, and the financial development efficiency indicators, i.e. deposit-to-loan ratio indicators, this paper studies the causality direction problem between financial development and economic growth of Anhui Province. The conclusion is that there exists bidirectional causality between financial scale expansion and economic growth in Anhui. In addition, the efficiency of financial development is a key factor in economic growth, but in reverse, economic growth does not promote the efficiency of financial development. Finally, through combining the actual situation of Anhui Province, it proposes suggestions conducive to its sustainable economic development.","Co-integration; Economic growth; Financial development; Granger causality test","Economics; Finance; Statistical tests; Annual time series; Cointegration; Continuous development; Economic growths; Efficiency indicators; Financial development; Granger causality test; Sustainable economic development; Economic and social effects; article; China; co integration test; economic development; empiricism; financial management; geography; granger causality test; gross national product; loan; policy; quantitative analysis; rural area; statistical parameters; unit root test; urban area",,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 71172190",,,"Tan, R., Financial Development Theory and China's Financial Development [M] (2010) Beijing: China Economic Press; Wang, D., Li, L., Ran, G., (2009) Economic Research, (9); Lin, Y., Sun, X., Preliminary Exploration of Optimal Financial Structure Theory in Economic Growth [J] (2009) Economic Research, (8); Yang, J., Liu, J., An Empirical Study of China's financial development and economic growth threshold effect [J] (2008) Journal of Chongqing University (Social Science Edition), (4); Lei, H., (2008) Theoretical Analysis and Empirical Test of Financial Intermediation and Economic Growth [J], (4). , Chongqing Institute of Technology (Social Science Edition); McKinnon, R.I., (1973) Money and Captain Economic Development [M], , Washing-ton, DC Brookings Institution","Xu, Y.; School of Management Science and Engineering, Anhui University of Finance and Economics, Bengbu Anhui, China",,,"Journal of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Research",,,,,09757384,,,,"English","J.

It involves deep and sensitive analysis of various financial, social, demographic and other pertinent data provided by the customers and about the customers for building a more accurate and robust electronic finance system. The classification problem is one of the major concerned in the process of analysing gamut of data; however, its complexity has ignited us to use machine learning-based approaches. In this paper, some machine learning algorithms have been studied and compared their effectiveness for credit risk assessment. Further, as an extension of our study, we develop a novel sliding window-based meta-majority voting ensemble learning to improve the prediction accuracy of credit risk assessment problem by properly analysing the underlying samples. The experimental findings draw a clear line between the proposed ensembler and traditional ensemblers.

The Stock Exchange of Iran has implemented Internet trading as a new electronic service delivery channel, but the acceptance by securities investors has not yet been measured to assess the value of the implemented system. The purpose of this study was to determine factors influencing the investors’ intention to adopt Internet stock trading platform in Iran. 385 active investors in Tehran stock market participated in this cross-sectional study. We developed a questionnaire as the measurement tool in this research. The questionnaire was administered using self-report approach. Based on the decomposed technology acceptance model (DTAM), the study integrates two new constructs of economic value (time saving and cost reduction) and perceived trust as antecedents of investors’ intention to adopt Internet platform. The structural equation model by Amos software version 19 was used for analyzing and interpreting the data. We found significant relation between perceived usefulness (β = 0.32); ease of use (β = 0.48), trust (β = 0.43) as well as cost reduction (β = 0.33) and investors intention. Attitude was found to be a partial mediator for the effect of perceived usefulness on investor’s intention to adopt online stock trading. Our Findings confirm that the DTAM can be successfully applied to the domain of e-business service in developing countries such as Iran and other countries with similar status of e-finance adoption. Findings could be considered as guidelines for decision makers in stock exchange to develop better strategies and practical procedures. © 2013, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","E-business; E-finance; Economic value; Investors intention; Stock trading; Technology acceptance model",,,,,,,,,"Abroud, A., Choong, Y.V., Muthaiyah, S., Preparation of measurement tools of the effective factors for the acceptance of online stock trading (2010) Eur J Econ Finance Admin Sci, 4 (19), pp. 34-41; Abzari, M., Safari, A., Electronic stock exchange and its development in Iran (2005) Electron New Comm, 2 (2), pp. 86-106; Adela, L., Jerome, Y., Patrick, Y.K.C., Adoption of online trading in the Hong Kong financial market (2001) J Electron Comm Res, 2 (2), pp. 54-71; Agarwal, R., Prasad, J., Are individual differences germane to the acceptance of new information technologies?

These platforms create a dynamic funding network. We use data collected from Kickstarter, the largest crowdfunding platform, to study some of these network dynamics. We focus on project owners who choose to operate on both sides of the market, backing the projects of others. We study the impact of such out-of-project actions on the successful financing of projects. We find that an owner's backinghistory has a significant effect on financing outcomes. We also show that owners who are backers form a sub-community which is active in backing projects, especially those initiated by its members. We find evidence for both direct and indirect reciprocity. Backing the projects of other is a rewarding strategy. Projects created by active backers have higher success rates, attract more backers and collect more funds. © (2013) by the AIS/ICIS Administrative Office All rights reserved.","Crowdfunding; E-Finance; IS-Economics; Reciprocity; Social Networks","Commerce; Crowdsourcing; Information systems; Information use; Social networking (online); Crowdfunding; E finances; Indirect reciprocities; Network dynamics; Project owners; Reciprocity; Small investments; Investments",,,,,,,,"Agrawal, A.K., Catalini, C., Goldfarb, A., (2011) The Geography of Crowdfunding, , http://www.nber.org/papers/w16820, Working Paper 16820, National Bureau of Economic Research; Ahlers, G., Cumming, D., Guenther, C., Schweizer, D., Signaling in Equity Crowdfunding (2012) Available at SSRN 2161587; Aldrich, H., Zimmer, C., Entrepreneurship through social networks (1986) University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign's Academy for Entrepreneurial Leadership Historical Research Reference in Entrepreneurship; Alexy, O.T., Block, J.H., Sandner, P., Ter Wal, A.L., Social capital of venture capitalists and start-up funding (2012) Small Business Economics, 39 (4), pp. 835-851; Bateman, P.J., Gray, P.H., Butler, B.S., Research Note-The Impact of Community Commitment on Participation in Online Communities (2011) Information Systems Research, 22 (4), pp. 841-854; Belleflamme, P., Lambert, T., Schwienbacher, A., Crowdfunding: Tapping the right crowd (2010) International Conference of the French Finance Association, pp. 11-13. , in; Burtch, G., Ghose, A., Wattal, S., An Empirical Examination of the Antecedents and Consequences of Contribution Patterns in Crowd-Funded Markets (2012) Available at SSRN 1928168; Butler, B.S., Membership size, communication activity, and sustainability: A resource-based model of online social structures (2001) Information systems research, 12 (4), pp. 346-362; Cassell, J., Huffaker, D., Tversky, D., Ferriman, K., The language of online leadership: Gender and youth engagement on the Internet (2006) Developmental Psychology, 42 (3), pp. 436-449; Chen, X.-P., Yao, X., Kotha, S., Entrepreneur passion and preparedness in business plan presentations: A persuasion analysis of venture capitalists' funding decisions (2009) Academy of Management Journal, 52 (1), pp. 199-214; Dimov, D., Shepherd, D.A., Sutcliffe, K.M., Requisite expertise, firm reputation, and status in venture capital investment allocation decisions (2007) Journal of Business Venturing, 22 (4), pp. 481-502; Eisenmann, T., Parker, G., Van Alstyne, M.W., Strategies for two-sided markets (2006) Harvard business review, 84 (10), p. 92; Gerber, E.M., Hui, J.S., Kuo, P., Crowdfunding: Why people are motivated to post and fund projects on crowdfunding platforms (2012) Proceedings of the International Workshop on Design, Influence, and Social Technologies: Techniques, Impacts and Ethics, , In; Giudici, G., Nava, R., Rossi Lamastra, C., Verecondo, C., (2012) Crowdfunding: The New Frontier for Financing Entrepreneurship?, , Available at SSRN 2157429; Gladwell, M., (2000) The tipping point: How little things can make a big difference, , Little, Brown and Co; Gompers, P., Kovner, A., Lerner, J., Scharfstein, D., Performance persistence in entrepreneurship (2010) Journal of Financial Economics, 96 (1), pp. 18-32; Hemer, J., (2011) A snapshot on crowdfunding, , Working Papers; Hill, S., Provost, F., Volinsky, C., Network-based marketing: Identifying likely adopters via consumer networks (2006) Statistical Science, pp. 256-276; Hoang, H., Antoncic, B., Network-based research in entrepreneurship: A critical review (2003) Journal of business venturing, 18 (2), pp. 165-187; Hsu, D.H., Experienced entrepreneurial founders, organizational capital, and venture capital funding (2007) Research Policy, 36 (5), pp. 722-741; Iyengar, R., Van den Bulte, C., Valente, T.W., Opinion leadership and social contagion in new product diffusion (2011) Marketing Science, 30 (2), pp. 195-212; Kim, A.J., (2000) Community building on the web: Secret strategies for successful online communities, , Addison-Wesley Longman Publishing; Kim, Y.A., Srivastava, J., Impact of social influence in e-commerce decision making (2007) Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Electronic commerce, ACM, pp. 293-302. , in, New York, NY, USA; Kleemann, F., Voß, G.G., Rieder, K., Un (der) paid Innovators: The Commercial Utilization of Consumer Work through Crowdsourcing (2008) Science, Technology & Innovation Studies, 4 (1), pp. 5-26; Kollock, P., The Economies of Online Cooperation: Gifts, and Public Goods in Cyberspace (1999) Communities in cyberspace, pp. 220-239. , in, M.A. Smith and P.

World's first commodity exchange, the Chicago Board of Trade was started in the USA in 1848 and in India, Bombay Cotton Trade Association Ltd started commodity exchange in year 1875. At present in India, total number of recognised commodity exchanges is 23 including six national level electronic commodity exchanges, which are dealing in more than 100 commodities together. The present paper is an attempt to study the growth of commodity exchanges in India. Keeping the recent intensification in Indian commodity exchanges in mind, the aim of this paper is to outline the history, evolution, regulatory framework and growth of commodity exchange. Hence the present paper reviews and examines the various issues related to commodity exchanges currently operating in India.

The research uses Amartya Sen's Capability Approach, with results indicating that for all social classes the use of e-government is strongly related to users' capabilities, expressed by their use of e-mail, e-commerce and efinance and that its use is favored by home and workplace access to the internet over other alternatives, such as lan-houses and public telecentres.

It remains a challenge for the banks to figure out how to attract more customers to adopt the use of banking services via an internet channel. This study aims at examining the factors that impact the acceptance of the use of internet banking in Thailand. A total of 697 subjects participated in this study. Data were collected via both interview and survey. The findings suggest factors that banks should consider when implementing internet services, thus allowing them to design an internet service that meets the needs of their customers. © 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","E-finance; Internet banking; Normative beliefs; Perceived trustworthiness; Privacy; Security; Social factors; TAM; Technology acceptance model; Thailand; Theory of reasoned action; Voluntariness",,,,,,,"The first author would like to acknowledge the generous research scholarship from Shinawatra University that makes this research possible.

We posit that gasoline price reflects the opportunity cost (monetary and time savings) of doing on line transactions; also the other independent variable, real income, characterises consumers' propensity for internet shopping. The econometric results, based on quarterly data from 1999 Q4 to 2010 Q3, indicate the significance of both independent variables. The gasoline price elasticity supports the behavioural hypothesis that high transport costs motivate online shopping; also the high sales (income) elasticity indicates the pro-cyclical characteristics of e-commerce retail sales. Stationarity and cointegration of the variables attest to the reliability of the results and the usefulness of the model for forecasting. The implications of the results are important; slow economic growth and volatile gasoline prices could create uncertainty in the growth of e-commerce sales; this could impact business planning for expenditures on information technology. © 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Consumer behaviour; E-finance; Electronic commerce; Gasoline price; Real income",,,,,,,,,"Bakos, Y., The emerging landscape for retail e-commerce (2001) Journal of Economic Perspectives, 15, pp. 69-80; Becker, G.S., A theory of the allocation of time (1965) The Economic Journal, 75 (299), pp. 493-517; Biswas, D., Biswas, A., The diagnostic role of signals in the context of perceived risks in on-line shopping: Do signals matter more on the web?

It appears to us that older people have just as much to gain from this technology, and possibly more, compared to younger people. We identified many potential motivations for smartphone use by the elderly, and also many obstacles. From this work we created a research framework which is the primary topic of this paper. A number of possible moderating variables were extrapolated as well. If seniors are going to benefit from mobile devices like the rest of the population, and if they are to become participants in the evolving world of m-commerce, mobile phones and services must pull seniors toward their use instead of driving them away. Only then will we be able to diminish the digital divide that exists between the young and the old, especially regarding smartphones. © 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Computers; Digital divide; Digital inclusion; E-finance; Elderly; Information technology; Older people; Quality of life; Senior citizens; Smartphones",,,,,,,,,"Bailey, J.L., Jensen, B.K., Telementoring: Using the kinect and microsoft azure to save lives (2011) International Journal of Electronic Finance, 5 (4), pp. 333-356; Benders, J., Schouteten, R., de Ruijsscher, C., Mobile phones are changing the way we work (2012) International Journal of Electronic Finance, 6 (2), pp. 184-197; Bernadas, C., Verville, J., Burton, J., A myriad of digital divides: A global comparison of internet and cellular divides (2012) International Journal of Intercultural Information Management, 3 (1), pp. 15-44; Biljon, J., Kotze, P., Cultural factors in a mobile phone adoption and usage model (2008) Journal of Universal Computer Science, 14 (16), pp. 2650-2679; Birren, J.E., Schoots, J.J., (1996) Handbook of the Psychology of Aging, , Academic Press, San Diego, CA; Branch, X., China into the 'low birth rate' social problems exacerbated old before getting rich (2011) China News, , http://www.cnkeyword.info/china-into-the-low-birth-rate-socialproblems-exacerbated-old-before-getting-rich-figure/, Online, Accessed 13 July, 2011; Caldwell, C., Zeltmann, S., Griffin, K., BYOD (bring your own device) (2012) Competition Forum, 10 (2), pp. 117-121; Carmeli, E., Patish, H., Coleman, R., The aging hand (2003) The Journal of Gerontology Series A: Medical Sciences, 58 (2), pp. M146-M152; Clark, A., Concejero, P., Services for the elderly, smart phones and the digital divide (2010) The PRISMA (Providing Innovative Service Models and Assessment), , Project IST-1999-29088 is supported by the EU in the fifth framework programme; Conci, M., Pianesi, F., Zancanaro, M., Useful, social and enjoyable: Mobile phone adoption by older people (2009) Human-Computer Interaction - INTERACT 2009: Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 5726 (2009), pp. 63-76; Coursaris, C.K., Boylan, C., Taylor, J., Enabling mgovernment: A framework and a case study (2012) International Journal of Electronic Finance, 6 (1), pp. 79-101; Czaja, S.J., Lee, C.C., Designing computer systems for older adults (2002) Handbook of Human-Computer Interaction, pp. 413-427. , Jacko, J. and Sears, A.

In general, as industry advances, more college level jobs are required. However, an overemphasis in college education creates a surplus of college graduates, and the overqualified surplus start taking high school jobs. Meanwhile, more college graduates are considering upper-level degrees in order to secure their 'college-level' jobs. If this situation permeates, then what would be the financial benefit for the college graduates in high school jobs? This study shows that, however, college graduates tend to have better pay with better job security by taking jobs away from high school graduates. Society will have less efficiency since many will spend extra years in college even though they will not work in occupations that require these degrees (Hecker, 1992).

With the mobile penetration of nearly 70% in India, mobile payments services have huge potential in the country; however, customer adoption of mobile payment systems is very low. Therefore, there is a need for research to identify the factors affecting consumer intention to use mobile payment systems. To get meaningful comprehensive insights on customers' perception and usage intention of mobile payment systems, current research validates a model based on Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) using a sample of urban population from two metros in India. The empirical findings indicate that the constructs of performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence and facilitating conditions have significant impact on mobile payment services adoption among the consumers. This study provides insights into mobile payment services in India which has not been investigated well. Also, there is lack of studies which connect consumer attitudinal factors like performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence and facilitating conditions in the e-finance and mobile finance context especially in India. © 2013, SAGE Publications.","Consumer behavior; e-commerce; innovation; mobile payment services; technology acceptance",,,,,,,,,"Agarwal, R., Prasad, J., The role of innovation characteristics and perceived voluntariness in the acceptance of information technologies (1997) Decision Sciences, 28, pp. 557-582; Agarwal, R., Prasad, J., A conceptual and operational definition of personal innovativeness in the domain of Information Technology (1998) Information Systems Research, 9 (2), pp. 204-215; Ajzen, I., The theory of planned behavior (1991) Organisational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50 (2), pp. 179-211. , P.

The invocation of the methods is performed from a Smartphone or a PC, while the execution will be on a server that returns an understandable result through WSDL (Web Service Description Language) generated by web services, where the transport is provided by SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol). © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","Case studies; E-finance; Tools and applications; Unified Modeling Language; Web services","E-finance; Enterprise applications; Geographic isolation; Microfinance; Simple object access protocols; Transaction cost; Unified modeling languages (UML); Web service description language; Database systems; Information services; Rural areas; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Signal encoding; Smartphones; Unified Modeling Language; Websites; Web services",,,,,,,,"Amsden, J., (2007) Modeling SOA, Parts I-V, , IBM developerWorks October; AspectJ, , http://www.eclipse.org/aspectj; Arsanjani, A., (2004) Service-oriented Modeling and Architecture, , IBM developerWorks November; Belouadha, F.-Z., Roudiès, O., Un profil UML de spécification de services web composites sémantiques (2008) Colloque Africain Sur la Recherche en Informatique et en Mathématiques Appliquées, Rabat, pp. 537-544; Bernard, G., Ben-Othman, J., Bouganim, L., Canals, G., Defude, B., Ferrié, J., Gançarski, S., Valduriez, P., Mobilité et Bases de Données, Etat de L'art et Perspectives, , http://www-smis.inria.fr/dataFiles/P03a.pdf; Dagba, T.K., An UML based framework for online and non-traceable E-cash system IEEE 5th International Conference on Broadband and Biomedical Communications, Malaga (2010), , doi:10.1109/IB2COM.2010.5723630; Informatique Mobile, , http://www.gfi.fr/gfilabs/common/docs/Offre-Technologique-Informatique- Mobile.pdf; Hnatkowska, B., Kasprzyk, K., Integration of Application Business Logic and Business Rules with DSL and AOP. e-Informatica (2010) Software Engineering Journal, 4, pp. 59-69; Huang, H.C., Chang, F.C., Fang, W.C., Reversible Data Hiding with Histogram-Based Difference Expansion for QR Code Applications (2011) IEEE Trans.

In addition, we compare the differences of the effect of IT on the insurance industry across countries. Moreover, we test the international market's integration hypothesis and explore the influences of other factors (e.g., scope economy, macroeconomic variables, etc.) on the cost efficiencies of the insurance industry. The evidence from both the two-equation and Tobit models indicates that IT improves cost efficiencies for the developed countries but reduces those for the newly developed economies under study. That is, the international productivity paradox hypothesis is rejected for the insurance firms in the developed countries considered. In addition, results of the cost frontiers for the insurance firms suggest that, IT improves the cost efficiency for the developed countries but not for the emerging economies. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",,"Cost efficiency; Cost frontier; Developed countries; Developed economies; Emerging economies; Financial institution; Insurance industry; International markets; Macroeconomic variables; Productivity paradox; Scope economies; Two-equation; Cost effectiveness; Database systems; Industry; Insurance; International trade; Information technology",,,,,,,,"Allen, F., McAndrews, J., Stratran, P., E-Finance: An Introduction (2002) Journal of Financial Services Research, 22, pp. 5-28; Alpar, P., Kim, M., A Microeconomic Approach to the Measurement of Information Technology Value (1991) Journal of Management Information Systems, 7, pp. 55-69; Berger, A.N., Hunter, W.C., Timme, S.G., The Efficiency of Financial Institutions: A Review and Preview of Research: Past, Present, and Future (1993) Journal of Banking and Finance, 17, pp. 221-249; Claessens, S., Glaessner, T., Klingebiel, D., Electronic Finance, Reshaping the Financial Landscape Around the World (2002) Journal of Financial Services Research, 22, pp. 29-62; Dewan, S., Kraemer, K.L., Information Technology and Productivity: Evidence from Country-Level Data (2000) Management Science, 46, pp. 548-562; Forman, C., Gron, A., Vertical Integration and Information Technology Investment in the Insurance Industry (2011) Journal of Law, Economics, and Organization, 27 (1), pp. 180-218; Frei, F.X., Harker, P.T., Hunter, L.W., Inside the Black Box: What Makes a Bank Efficient (2000) Performance of Financial Institutions: Efficiency, Innovation, Regulation, pp. 259-311. , Cambridge University Press; Garven, J.R., The Role of Electronic Commerce in Financial Services Integration (2000) North American Actuarial Journal, 4 (3), pp. 64-70; Harris, S.E., Katz, J.L., Firm Size and the Information Technology Investment Intensity of Life Insurers (1991) MIS Quarterly, 15 (3), pp. 333-352; Hartmann, P., Comments on Claessens, Glaessner, and Klingebiel (2002) Journal of Financial Services Research, 22, pp. 63-71; Hunter, W.C., Timme, S.G., Technological Change in Large U S.

The purpose of this study is to explore how the healthcare industry can be more innovative in its use of social media. The literature was surveyed and it was found that the doctor/patient relationship was not being well supported. A social media platform geared towards healthcare is proposed as a solution. The creation of a social media platform geared towards healthcare would facilitate advances in the healthcare industry, as it has in other industries, and would provide the same opportunities for revenue generation that are enjoyed by those industries.

Forecasting price movements in the stock market has been a major challenge for common investors, businesses, brokers, and speculators. With the rapid growth of internet technologies, electronic finance (e-finance) has become a vital application of e-business. Thus, the primary area of concern is to determine the appropriate time to buy, hold or sell. Usually, one technical indicator may not be sufficient for making a trading decision. Rather, an optimal and potential set of indicators are used to provide confirmation of a technical hypothesis before taking actions. This paper suggests some useful information by processing past prices into an informative trading signal by testing ten potential indicators on the Dow Jones Index from 24 July 2000 to 22 October 2007, confirms which is potentially the best among them and finally builds a Neural Network (NN) model which is effective in improving the accuracy of stock price prediction.

The approach utilised in this paper is to develop a conceptual framework that includes a number of propositions that are developed and justified by the literature. The main findings of this paper are that people's entrepreneurial inclination and learning tendency will determine how they respond to marketing and knowledge about mobile banking. The practical implications are that financial institutions involved in e-finance can focus their marketing efforts at increasing people's exposure to mobile banking.

The results show that the factors explicit transaction costs, trading times, awareness of alternative trading systems and degree of personal involvement in the transaction all exert a positive effect on an online investor's preferential use of alternative trading systems, whereas regulatory supervision exerts a negative effect. Additionally, we observe that the effect of trading times is significantly lower for investors with no experience of alternative trading systems and the effect of regulatory supervision is significantly lower for investors who trade leveraged products.

These devices allow to split the waiters' jobs into separate tasks which tend to be combined into two separate ""s ub jobs"": the ""palmtopper""and the ""runner"". Whereas handhelds are not necessary for creating separate waiting jobs, the technology enables to create conditions under which it becomes attractive for management to opt for an increased division of labour. We show the contingent conditions and underlying mechanisms which explain why certain choices prevail.

Related literature in sum has illustrated how single/collaborative technology/brand effect transitions the behaviour of e-commerce consumers, and has brought to light those influence factors, as well as the relationship among multi factors. Empirical research methods based on TAM, TPB, TRA and IDT can be used for modelling e-commerce consumer acceptant behaviour, and a computational experiment method can represent the complex dynamic evolution process of consumer transition behaviour by integrating an agent-based model with a cognitive relationship framework determined by empirical data.

It is an interesting academic research question concerning this balance of productivity losses and gains in employee cohesiveness that warrants additional research in the intrinsic motivations of both management and their employees. From an empirical study, it was found that frequent e-ticket users were relatively secure in using such applications, while those with fewer exposures did suffer more fear of loss and exposure of personal information on the internet concerning the use of e-ticket options.

This paper aims at developing a m-health system to improve usability from a user's perspective. Specifically, it first developed a m-health model by logically linking characteristics of the m-health system together based on information flows. Then, the system requirements were collected by using a developed questionnaire. These requirements were structured and further in-depth analysis was conducted by using an object-oriented approach based on unified modelling language, such as use-case, sequence and analysis class diagrams. This research will be beneficial to decision makers and developers in the mobile healthcare industry.

For companies hoping to supply to the mobile demand there are two options: either create duplicate information for mobile devices or leverage their existing CMS data. As the creation of duplicate information is often excessively time consuming and costly, leveraging existing content and repurposing it to a mobile friendly format is the optimal route. This paper explores the case of Oakland County's eGovernment in this endeavor, and proposes a three-stage approach involving a Process Transformation Framework (PTF), a Mobile Content Platform (MCP), and an Asset Leverage Strategy (ALS), that affords flexibility, scalability and reuse of existing digital content by organisations for the mobile channel. In addition, the requisite market research to identify the web content and services of greatest value proposition to a government's constituents (residents) is presented.

Research methods that are used to conduct healthcare research are selected on the basis of study objectives and practicalities (i.e. finances, resources, time frame, etc.). The methodology of vignettes for conducting healthcare research consists of short descriptive scenarios and/or images to engage participants in hypothetical situations in which their emotional, psychological and sociological responses can be measured. They enable participants to feel comfortable in divulging responses that may be of a sensitive nature and provide insight to situations where they may have little or no experience. Two studies that used vignettes to conduct healthcare research will be discussed in terms of their objectives, conceptualisations, designs and developments, implementations, and outcomes. Validity of the vignettes as a methodology for conducting healthcare research will also be discussed. © 2013 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Adolescent; Diagnostic procedure; Information provision; Medical device; User needs; Vignette",,,,,,,,,"Alexander, C.S., Becker, H.J., The use of vignettes in survey research (1978) Public Opinion Quarterly, 42 (1), pp. 93-104; Barter, C., Renold, E., ‘I wanna tell you a story’: Exploring the application of vignettes in qualitative research with children and young people (2000) International Journal of Social Research Methodology, 3 (4), pp. 307-323; Keane, D., Craven, M.P., Sharples, S., Information provision and decision aids for diagnosis in clinical pathways (2011) Healthcare Systems Ergonomics and Patient Safety, , 2011, eds.

This study was carried out through a situational analysis and an in-depth questionnaire survey. This study identifies Perceived Usefulness (PU), Perceived Ease Of Use (PEOU), Perceived Mobility (PM), Perceived Cost (PC), Perceived Stability (PS) and Product Communication (PCom) as the main factors that influence the behaviour of the Sri Lankan public with respect to mobile payment services. While the first four factors are derived from the COMPASS acceptance model, the other two factors are a reflection of specific needs by the Sri Lankan public. Furthermore, PEOU, PU, PS and PCom have been identified as the major influencing factors, while PM and PC are of lesser importance. The methodology employed and the policies derived can be used as guides to similar types of research in other countries and to establish an effective mobile payments scheme.

Online signature verification is a very active and hot topic in the field of biometric research. It is a potential candidate to replace traditional password-based security system as the password can be forgotten, stolen or guessed. Online signature verification deals with both spatial and temporal features of signature. Therefore, it is difficult to forge. This paper proposes a novel online signature verification technique using dynamic programming of string matching. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated for both genuine signatures and skilled forgeries on SVC2004 database.

The huge progress of Internet technologies, the massive revolution of media and the use of electronic finance increasingly deployed in a world where the law of competition forces financial institutions to devote huge amounts of capital to invest in persistent digital worlds like Second Life or Entropia Universe whose economic impact is quite real [1]. Thus, virtual communities are rapidly becoming the next frontier for the cyber-crime. So, it is necessary to develop equitable tools for the protection of virtual environments, similar to those deployed in the real world, such as biometric security systems. In this paper, we present a biometric recognition system of non-biological entities (avatar) faces based on exploration of wavelet transform for characterization and Support Vector Machines for classification. This system is able to identify and verify avatars during their access to certain information or system resources in virtual communities. We also evaluate the performance of our avatar authentication approach focusing specifically on the classification stage. Obtained results are promising and encouraging for such first contribution within the framework of this new research field. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Avatar; Biometric; Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT); Face Recognition (FR); Support Vector Machines (SVM); Virtual world","Avatar; Biometric recognition system; Biometric security systems; Cybercrime; Digital world; Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT); Economic impacts; Facial recognition; Financial institution; Internet technology; Research fields; Second Life; SVM classification; System resources; Virtual community; Virtual environments; Virtual worlds; Biometrics; Discrete wavelet transforms; Face recognition; Internet; Neural networks; Social networking (online); Support vector machines; Virtual reality; Interactive computer graphics",,,,,,,,"Oursler, J.N., Price, M., Yampolskiy, R.V., Parameterized Generation of Avatar Face Dataset (2009) 14th International Conference on Computer Games: AI, Animation, Mobile, Interactive Multimedia, Educational &amp; Serious Games, Louisville, KY, pp. 17-22; Gavrilova, M.L., Yampolskiy, R.V., Applying Biometric Principles to Avatar Recognition (2010) International Conference on Cyberworlds, pp. 179-186. , IEEE Press, Canada; Peachey, A., Gillen, J., Livingstone, D., Smith-Robbins, S., Researching Learning in Virtual Worlds (2010) Human-Computer Interaction Series, pp. 369-380. , Springer, Heidelberg; Klare, B., Yampolskiy, R.V., Jain, A.K., (2011) Face Recognition in the Virtual World: Recognizing Avatar Faces, , Technical Report from MSU Computer Science and Engineering; Science & Technology News, , http://www.virtualworldsmanagement.com/2007/index.html; Boukhris, M., Essoukri Ben Amara, N., (2009) First Contribution to Avatar Facial Biometric, , Endof- studies Project.

In particular, it was assumed that these decision-makers seek not only to maximize their net revenues but also to minimize risk with the risk being penalized by a variable weight. The behaviors of the various decision-makers, including the consumers at demand markets for financial products, were explicited. The optimality conditions were derived, and it was demonstrated that the governing equilibrium conditions of the financial network economy can be formulated as a finite-dimensional variational inequality problem. Qualitative properties of the equilibrium financial flow and price pattern were provided. A computational procedure that exploits the network structure of the problem were proposed.","Electronic finance; Risk management; Supernetwork; Variational inequality",,,,,,,,,"Turner, P., E-finace and financial stability (2001) Open Doors: Foreign Participation in Financial Systems in Developing Countries, pp. 389-409. , Litan R., Masson P. and Pomerleano M., Washington: Brookings Institution; Claessens, S., Glaessner, T., Klingebiel, D., Electronic finance: Reshaping the financial landscape around the world www.worldbank.org, 2001-07/2011-05-01; Claessens, S., Glaessner, T., Klingebiel, D., E-Finance in emerging markets: Is leapfrogging posssible? www.worldbank.org, 2001-07/2011-05-01; Long, S., Online finance: The virtual threat (2000) The Economist, 5, pp. 1-46; Sato, S., Hawkins, J., Electronic finance: An overview of the issues (2001) Bank of International Settlements Paper, 7, pp. 1-12; Banks, E., (2001) E-Finance: The Electronic Revolution, , New York: John Wiley & Sons; Allen, H., Hawkins, J., Sato, S., Electronic trading and its implications for financial systems (2001) Bank of International Settlements Papers, 7, pp. 30-42; Mcandrews, J., Stefanidis, C., The emergence of electronic communications networks in US equity markets (2000) Current Issues in Economics and Finance, 6 (12), pp. 1-6; Economides, N., The impact of the internet on financial markets (2001) Journal of Financial Transformation, 1 (1), pp. 8-13; Nagurney, A., Dong, J., (2002) Supernetworks: Decision-Making in the Information Age, , Cheltenham: Edward Elgar Publishing; Nagurney, A., Ke, K., Financial networks with electronic transactions: Modeling, analysis, and computations (2003) Quantitative Finance, 3 (2), pp. 71-87; Nagurney, A., Dong, J., Zhang, D., A supply chain network equilibrium model (2002) Transportation Research E, 38 (5), pp. 281-303; Dong, J., Zhang, D., Nagurney, A., A supply chain network equilibrium model with random demands (2004) European Journal of Operational Research, 156 (1), pp. 194-212; Nagurney, A., Ke, K., Financial networks with intermediation (2001) Quantitative Finance, 1 (4), pp. 441-451; Nagurney, A., Cruz, J., International financial networks with intermediation: Modeling, analysis, and computations (2003) Computational Management Science, 1 (1), pp. 31-58; Nagurney, A., Cruz, J., International financial networks with electronic transactions (2003) NAGURNEY A.

To this end, this study contributes to the extant sales literature by delineating how and under what conditions salespeople's knowledge-sharing behaviors are motivated. The study reports two sets of findings that contribute to the sales literature. First, in response to a strong autonomy climate, self-efficacy and coworker relationship quality mediate the relationship between autonomy climate strength and knowledge-sharing behaviors. Second, drawing on situational strength theory, the research finds that knowledge-sharing behaviors benefit from coworker relationship quality under weak but not strong norms. The hypotheses are tested by employing a multilevel modeling technique that uses a sample of 222 salespeople from 38 organizations. Implications for sales theory and practice are discussed. © 2011 PSE National Educational Foundation.

It is, therefore, important that users of services such as online banking have confidence in such services. Frameworks such as Google Gears now have the ability to determine the physical location of a person in real time. This geographical information can be very useful in e-finance applications. If we know the geographical location of a computer performing a particular transaction, then we can ascertain whether unusual requests are being performed. This paper presents a prototype Geolocation enabled e-finance prototype to illustrate the benefits of monitoring geographical location of users.

Nevertheless, their performance is not always satisfactory. In this paper, the effect of using hybrid market indicators of technical, fundamental indicators and experts opinion for stock price prediction is examined. Input variables extracted from these market hybrid indicators are fed into a fuzzy-neural network for improved accuracy of stock price prediction. The empirical results obtained with published stock data shows that the proposed model can be effective to improve accuracy of stock price prediction.

The scope of the banking services to consumers has been extended in traditional banks from basic banking services to asset management, insurance and expert services. Deregulation and new technologies have enabled internationalisation and free competition. New organisations and niche players from other industries have entered the industry. Our findings add to previous research on the actual changes and the drivers and enablers of the business model evolution over time, and help practitioners to further develop their business models.

Different studies have proposed either anti-piracy or pro-piracy ways to solve the music industry's problems, but piracy still exists. In this paper, we build a mathematical model of a new revenue model which the music industry could implement in order to curb piracy. Our findings suggest that music industries should incorporate versioning of their products to target different types of consumers. Additionally, our analysis shows that by using this approach, the music industry cannot only reduce piracy but also increase revenues.

A conceptual model was developed, linking the constructs attitudes, attention, involvement and purchase intention in the context of mobile advertising. The model was tested with a sample of 250 young adults using Partial Least Squares (PLS) analysis. Findings indicated that a positive relationship exists between a consumer's attitude towards mobile advertising and his or her purchase intention. However, this relationship was found to be partially mediated by the attention that a consumer pays to the mobile advertisement, as well as his or her involvement in it.

The findings indicate the reluctance of the council in fully committing to e-procurement system while being not entirely motivated by financial gains. A major hurdle is the difficulty to integrate e-procurement to the council's financial applications. The study has implications for public sector financial managers and IT practitioners.

A survey was conducted among 220 internet banking users in Malaysia who represented the main banking customer base. The results show that customer satisfaction and customer loyalty enhance WOM. However, the effect of web usability is not significant on WOM. Even though the results confirm the findings of earlier studies, they suggest that there is room for improvement.

Lessons learned from the experiences of the government sector in Norway are useful in analysing the number of stages, dominant problems at each stage, evolutionary path, and the economies of interoperability. Using the organisational, semantic and technical parameters of the framework, benchmarks applicable to each stage are applied to the case studies. Findings indicate that governments face different issues, expectations and benefits, depending on their maturity level. © 2011 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd..

Linear regression-stepwise technique was used to realise the objective of the study. Results show that customer satisfaction is significantly correlated with customer loyalty, implying that high customer satisfaction leads to a high level of customer loyalty. The paper clearly shows that the proper understanding of the true e-statement quality domains by bank management will enable the banking industry to design customer-oriented marketing strategies. The value of the study stems from the fact that it is the only paper of its kind that addresses this issue in Malaysia.

One of the issues arising with the efforts to this realisation is the assurance of secure transactions while withholding high privacy standards. Different systems require different levels of security according to the services they provide to their users. This paper presents a survey of security measures implemented in e-government projects both locally (in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia) and internationally, beginning with more established e-government systems around the world. Security of these systems will then be evaluated accordingly to a defined list of security requirements fitting the needs of local e-government projects. This will be the basis for the design and implementation of an e-transaction multilevel security system for e-government systems and for its evaluation.

This application allows nonexpert users to easily create SPARQL queries that can be issued over most existing ontology storage systems.

It was found that most professionals are generally optimistic about their personal employment security, regardless of if they perceived their chosen career path to be recession-proof. Although there were no gender differences, younger, more technologically savvy professionals were more confident in the economy and their personal security than their older counterparts. Overall, governmental financial bailouts were not perceived as good strategies for economical and employment stability.

In particular, Internet banking service is providing more convenience than other electronic financial service since the users can enable financial transaction by directly looking at the screen at anyplace where Internet access is possible [2]. The increase in the rate of intrusion accident, due to the fact that customer information is not systematically managed while it is being internally and attacks incurred by advanced social engineering techniques are increasing, is becoming an obstacle in the growth of electronic financial transaction.

Defined as “a group of permanent disorders of the development of movement and posture”, CP occurs in approximately 2 to 2.5 per 1,000 live births. In recent years, the concept of good health has moved from the “absence of disease” to a more positive concept, which embraces quality of life (QoL). QoL is a multi-dimensional construct including both health (i.e., physical health, emotional health, social health) and nonhealth domains (i.e., finances, school, autonomy). In pediatrics and child health, there is growing awareness that mortality and morbidity are not the only important outcome variables to be considered. Within the area of childhood CP, clinicians and researchers are more aware than ever that CP-related interventions need to go beyond treating physical functioning and must take a holistic approach to increase a child’s QoL. What is CP? Cerebral palsy is the most common physical disability in childhood. Caused by “nonprogressive disturbances that occurred in the developing fetal or infant brain”, CP is characterized by limited functional ability and is often accompanied by “disturbances of sensation, perception, cognition, communication, and behavior, by epilepsy, and by secondary musculoskeletal problems”. During the past three decades, cases of CP have been on the increase, likely because of advances in neonatal care and improved documentation of confirmed cases. © Cambridge University Press 2011.",,,,,,,,,,"Rosenbaum, P., Paneth, N., Leviton, A., Goldstein, M., Bax, M., Damiano, D., Dan, B., Jacobsson, B., A report: The definition and classification of cerebral palsy april 2006 (2007) Devmed Child Neurol, 109, pp. 8-14; Blair, E., Watson, L., Badawi, N., Stanley, F.J., Life expectancy among people with cerebral palsy in western australia (2001) Dev Med Child Neurol, 43, pp. 508-515; Waters, E., Maher, E., Salmon, L., Reddihough, D., Boyd, R., Development of a condition-specific measure of quality of life for children with cerebral palsy: Empirical thematic data reported by parents and children (2005) Child Care Hlth Dev, 31 (2), pp. 127-135; Rumeau-Rouquette, C., Grandjean, H., Cans, C., Du Mazaubrum, C., Verrier, A., Prevalence and time trends of disabilities in school-age children (1997) Int J Epidemiol, 26, pp. 137-145; Brehaut, J.C., Kohen, D.E., Raina, P., Walter, S.D., Russell, D.J., Swinton, M., O’Donnell, M., Rosenbaum, P., The health of primary caregivers of children with cerebral palsy: How does it compare with that of other canadian caregivers?

It then analyses the role of institutions on diffusion of e-finance. Lastly, a framework for efinance adoption by SMEs has been developed and strategies for further development of e-finance have been formulated. While the framework (and strategies) have been developed for Bangladesh, they have applicability to other developing as well as developed countries (with a lesser role to be played by international donor agencies), as most SMEs have structural limitations and limited opportunities to participate in traditional markets.","E-business; E-finance; Small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs)","Bangladesh; Developed countries; E finances; eBusiness; Financial service; International donors; Small and medium-sized enterprise; Traditional markets; Finance; Research; Industry",,,,,,,,"Abdullah, M.A., Beal, T., The strategic contributions of small and medium enterprises to the economies of japan and malaysia: Some comparative lessons for malaysian SMEs (2002) The Seventh International Conference on Global Business and Economic Development, , University of Wellington, New Zealand paper presented at, January 8-11, 2003, Bangkok; Allen, F., Strahan, P., McAndrews, J., E-Finance: An introduction (2002) Journal of Financial Services Research, (22), pp. 5-27; Awal, (2004) Internet in Bangladesh: Past, Present & A Better Future, , Asia Pacific Networking Group; Azam, M., Shah, D., Implementation of B2C E-commerce in Bangladesh: The effects of buying culture and E-infrastructure (2007) Advances in Global Business Research, 3 (1), pp. 55-81; Bakta, N.C., Sarder, M.M.R., Reza, M.S., Online banking: Bangladesh perspectives (2007) The XVI Biennial Conference of Bangladesh Economic Association, , Paper presented at, Dhaka; Indifferent definition of small and medium enterprise sector (2008) ACSPD Circular, (8). , Bangladesh Bank, dated 26/05/2008; Berger, A.N., Frame, W.S., Small business credit scoring and credit availability (2007) Journal of Small Business Management, 45 (1), pp. 5-22; Bunker, D.J., MacGregor, R.C., Successful generation of information technology (IT) requirements for small/medium enterprises (SME's)-cases from regional australia (2000) Proceedings of SMEs in A Global Economy, pp. 72-84. , Wollongong, Australia; Celik, H., What determines turkish customers' acceptance of internet banking?

This is due to many reasons including the fact that the healthcare industry is faced with many complex challenges in trying to deliver cost-effective, high-value, accessible healthcare and has traditionally been slow to embrace new business techniques and technologies. The goal of this paper is to develop a framework to assess a country's e-health preparedness with respect to embracing e-health (the application of e-commerce to healthcare) and thus enable a country to identify as well as address areas that require further attention in order for it to undertake a successful e-health initiative.","E-health; Framework; Healthcare; Healthcare information systems; Infrastructure; Tele-medicine","E-education; e-Government; eBusiness; Ehealth; Framework; Healthcare industry; Healthcare information systems; Infrastructure; Service industries; Electronic commerce; Health; Health care; Information systems; Medical computing",,,,,,,,"(2001) Crossing the Quality Chasm - A New Health System for the 21st Century Committee on Quality of Health Care, , America Institute of Medicine .

These applications strictly require data authentication mechanisms. To address this essential issue, we grasp the idea of client based authenticity for interactive web technologies. We proposed a novel client based web form signing and checking with XML data structure method. Our method specifically uses XML structure for the involvement of data exchange between web applications. Our method curbs the DoS (Denial of Service) attacks for protection of the server. In order to illustrate our ideas, we adapted our digital signature mechanism on health related forms with two commonly used web browsers.

Thus, the question arises which factors drive or hinder their adoption. This paper develops a model to evaluate institutional investors' intentions to adopt the meta-technology we call non-delegated order handling. It focuses on the usage of IT-driven trading systems which enable investors to control the choice of trading venue, order slicing, and timing themselves instead of delegating the execution of stock trading to an intermediary. Therefore the theory of task-technology-fit is integrated into the technology acceptance model. Further, it was successfully tested on data from the largest European institutional investors. The results outline that the perceived fit among the system?s capabilities and individual trading requirements is the main driver for adoption. Secondly, performance expectations fuel the intention to use trading innovations. Thirdly, for the expected efforts only a weak effect could be shown. Finally, factors like contractual barriers and competitive pressure which investors cannot control do not substantially affect their adoption decision.","E-finance; Electronic markets; Electronic value chains; Information technology adoption","Adoption decision; Competitive pressure; E-finance; Electronic market; Information technology adoption; Innovation adoption; Order handling; Performance expectations; Stock trading; Technological innovation; Technology acceptance model; Trading systems; Value chains; Digital storage; Information systems; Investments; Commerce",,,,,,,,"Ajzen, I., The theory of planned behavior (1991) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50 (2), pp. 179-211; Rajkumar, T.M., Benamati, J., An empirical study of the applicability of the technology acceptance model to application development outsourcing decisions (2003) 9th AMCIS, pp. 1594-1606; Cane, S., McCarthy, R., Analyzing the factors that affect information system use: A task- Technology fit meta-analysis (2009) JCI S, 50 (1), pp. 108-123; Cassel, C., Hackl, P., Westlund, A.H., Robustness of partial least-squares method for estimating latent variable quality structures (1999) Journal of Applied Statistics, 26, pp. 435-446; Chin, W., (1998) The Partial Least Square Approach to Structural Equation Modeling, Modern Methods for Business Research, pp. 295-336. , Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Mahwah, NJ, USA; Cohen, J., (1988) Statistical Power and Analysis for Behavioral Science, , 2nd edition, Hillsdale; Davis, F.D., Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and user acceptance of information technology (1989) MIS Quarterly, 13 (3), pp. 319-340; Davis, F.D., Bagozzi, R.P., Warshaw, P.R., User acceptance of computer technology: A comparison of two theoretical models (1989) Management Science, 35, pp. 982-1003. , 8; Diamantopoulos, A., Winklhofer, H.M., Index construction with formative indicators: An alternative to scale development (2001) Journal of Marketing Research, 38, pp. 269-277; Dishaw, M.T., Strong, D.M., Supporting software maintenance with software engineering tools: A Computed task-technology fit analysis (1998) Journal of Systems and Software, 44 (2), pp. 107-120; Dishaw, M.T., Strong, D.M., Extending the technology acceptance model with tasktechnology fit constructs (1999) Information and Management, 36 (1), pp. 9-21; Domowitz, I., Yegerman, H., The cost of algorithmic trading.

Deriving optimal execution strategies that minimize transaction costs, automated trading engines need to forecast future liquidity levels. By means of an empirical study we provide evidence that the publication of regulatory corporate disclosures is followed by abnormal liquidity levels. As we do not find abnormal liquidity levels prior to the publication, we assume the content to be largely unanticipated. Forecasting models purely based on quantitative input data may therefore not be able to pick up on the liquidity trends in a timely manner. Against this background, we propose two trading signals that allow automated trading engines to appropriately react to news-related liquidity shocks: First, a simple binary ""news"" or ""no news"" signal. Second, a signal that indicates whether or not the publication of a regulatory corporate disclosure will be followed by a negative liquidity shock. Utilizing text mining techniques, the content of the corporate disclosures is analyzed to extract the trading signal. The trading signals are evaluated within a simulation-based use case and turn out to be valuable. We strongly advise developers of automated trading engines to integrate unstructured qualitative data into their models, i.e. the proposed trading signals.","And simulation; Automated trading; E-finance; Forecasting; Liquidity; Text mining","And simulation; Automated trading; E-finance; Liquidity; Text mining; Automation; Data mining; Forecasting; Information systems; Publishing; Signal processing; Commerce",,,,,,,,"Bikker, J., Spierdijk, L., Hoevenaars, R., Van Der Sluis, P.J., Forecasting Market impact costs and identifying expensive trades (2006) Working Paper, University of Twente, , Netherlands; Brooks, R., Patel, A., Su, T., How the equity market responds to unanticipated events (2003) Journal of Business, 76, pp. 109-133; Brücher, H., Knolmayer, G., Mittermayer, M.-A., Document classification methods for organizing explicit knowledge (2002) European Conference on Organizational Knowledge, Learning and Capabilities, , Athens, Greece; Campbell, J.Y., Lo, A.W., MacKinlay, A.C., (1997) The Econometrics of Financial Markets, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, USA; Coggins, R., Lim, M., Lo, K., Algorithmic trade execution and market impact (2006) Working Paper, University of Sydney; Deutsche, B.A.G., Integrity for financial markets (2008) Annual Report 2008, , http://www.deutsche-boerse.com, 2009-08-09; Domowitz, I., Yegerman, H., (2005) The Cost of Algorithmic Trading - A First Look at Comparative Performance, pp. 30-40. , Bruce, B.R.

The two key findings are: (i) in the loan rate determination stage, the potential entrant's loan rate is negatively related to its involvement level in e-finance with its own strategic substitutes, to the incumbent's involvement level in e-finance in realization of a more risky state of the world, and to the degree of contestability in realization of a less risky state and (ii) in the technology choice stage, the potential entrant's involvement level in e-finance is positively related to the incumbent's own strategic complements, and to the degree of contestability in realization of a more risky state. The results suggest that a potential entrant's banking investment depends on strong strategic management practices and the realization of risky states of the world. © 2010 World Scientific Publishing Co. and Center for Pacific Basin Business, Economics and Finance Research.","Capital regulation; E-finance; Entry deterrence; Loan rate","banking; capital flow; competition (economics); financial market; interest rate; investment; lending behavior",,,,,,,,"Adams, R., Mehran, H., Is corporate governance different for bank holding companies?

On-line market exchanges are usually characterized by uncertainty and risk. Since trust-building mechanisms and establishing trust can reduce the uncertainty arising from information asymmetries in exchange transactions, trust-building mechanisms are crucial to the prosperity of on-line marketplaces. Based on the elaboration likelihood model (ELM), which explains attitudinal change, trust-building mechanisms for P2P lending marketplaces are investigated empirically and tested. The study uses data collected from Prosper, the largest U. S. P2P lending marketplace. The results support the importance of the central route (economic status) as the major driver for bidding behavior and of peripheral cues (social capital and listing quality) as trust-building mechanisms that influence trust behavior. These findings will help on-line marketplace providers to build successful P2P lending marketplaces. Copyright © 2011 M.E. Sharpe, Inc.

Either methods, reservation and payment operations are done in piece-meal fashion; this is cost prohibitive, time consuming and tedious leading to inefficiency. We present an integrated mobile airline reservation and payment system. Ours is a Client/Proxy/Server system with the proxy layer serving as mobility-aware middle layer providing real-time self service support. The study shows that mobile technology is matured for airline operators in developing countries as an avenue to improve efficiency, reduce operation costs, improved revenue generation and provision of value-added customer service for airline passengers.

Unauthorised triggering of such computerised models has been overlooked in the security literature. In this paper, we propose two frameworks to analyse the security of systems that have the data-triggering computerised model architecture. The frameworks help understand how to mitigate the cyber attacks that can be launched against the data-model systems, by modifying the computerised models or the data. We then propose a Deterministic Specification distributed intrusion Detection System (DSdIDS) to secure the data-triggering model systems from internal as well as external cyber threats.

A survey in 195 e-bidding winners was carried through to test the relation between the price variation and representative variables of transaction-cost theory. Through analysis of correlation and multiple linear regression, the number of suppliers, the specificity of the assets, the purchased amount and the frequency of the transactions had a combined explanation influence on 67.4% of the variations of the prices.

Then, we compare investor responses to internet stocks with those to traditional stocks to find how the internet bubble formed. Empirical results confirm that the internet bubble existed between 1998 and 1999, but began to evaporate in early 2000. Further, we find that the internet bubble formed due to investors' irrational overreaction to internet firms' positive outlooks and underreaction to internet firms' negative outlooks relative to their reactions to traditional firms. This finding supports our hypotheses that asset bubbles formed due to investors' extreme risk-seeking asymmetric responses to good and bad information.

The second part entails the analysis of hypotheses and data-reduction techniques regarding the credit crunch. The effects of credit crunch are also numerous and generally include consumer insolvency, change in purchasing patterns, decreased reliance on credit, to name a few impacts as measured in this study. It was inferred from the hypothesis-testing process that consumer spending was negatively affected by stricter credit standards imposed by lending institutions during the credit crunch and that the number of purchases made by consumers with their credit cards decreases while those made with cash increased during the same time period.

One hundred accountants’ offices in a Greek county answered the questionnaire. The findings present their current ICT infrastructure and their use of ICT and accounting e-services. Greek accounting offices have made improvements in adopting new technology in their everyday work. All use email, antivirus software, and the Web. Most submit VAT (Value Aided Tax), Taxation Statements, and APS (Analytical Periodic Statement) via Internet. However, most are not cautious about backing up their data daily; they do not create electronic files for all their documents; they do not update their software via Internet; and they do not use advanced software applications. Finally, they expect the government and the Accountants’ Chamber to finance their ICT infrastructure. © 2010, IGI Global.

Against this background, IT-based sophisticated order routing systems (Smart Order Routing systems) promise to assure efficiency despite fragmented markets. This raises the question on the relevance and economic value of this technology in European equity trading. Based on order book data for EURO STOXX 50 securities of ten European electronic execution venues, this paper assesses the potential of Smart Order Routing technology by measuring the performance of actual executions in European order book trading relative to a Smart Order Router implementation that detects and accesses best European prices. We identify 6.71% full trade troughs and 6.45% partial trade-throughs in our dataset enabling for significant absolute and relative savings. This indicates that Smart Order Routing technology can provide business value by improving order executions in European cross-tradable equities. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2009.","Auction; e-Finance; Economics of IS; Empirical Study; Marketplaces","Auction; E finances; Economics of is; Empirical studies; Marketplaces; Electronic commerce; Technology; World Wide Web; Economics",,,,,,,,"Kempf, A., Korn, O., Trading System and Market Integration (1998) Journal of Financial Intermediation, 7, pp. 220-239; Theissen, E., Market structure, informational efficiency and liquidity: An experimental comparison of auction and dealer markets (2000) Journal of Financial Markets, 3, pp. 333-363; Gomber, P., Gsell, M., Catching up with technology-The impact of regulatory changes on ECNs/MTFs and the trading venue landscape in Europe (2006) Competition and Regulation in Network Industries, 1 (4), pp. 535-557; (2006) Background Notes to Draft Commission Directive implementing Directive 2004/39/EC, , http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/securities/docs/isd/dir-2004-39-implement/dir-backgroundnote_en.pdf, European Commission, February 6, (last accessed: 15.06.2008); Jeffs, L., (2008) Instinet chief expects boost in volumes, , http://www.efinancialnews.com/index/content/2350621038, May, (retrieved 09/25/08); Kohli, R., Grover, V., Business value of IT: An essay on expanding research directions to keep with the times (2008) Journal of the Association for Information Systems, 9 (1), pp. 23-39; Huang, R., Stoll, H., Dealer vs. auction markets: A paired comparison of execution costs on Nasdaq and the NYSE (1996) Journal of Financial Economics, 41, pp. 313-357; Bessembinder, H., Kaufman, H.M., A cross-exchange comparison of execution costs and information flow for NYSE-listed stocks (1997) Journal of Financial Economics, 46 (3), pp. 293-319; Petersen, M., Fialkowski, D., Posted versus effective spreads (1994) Journal of Financial Economics, 35, pp. 269-292; Battalio, R., Hatch, B., Jennings, R., Post-reform Market-order Execution Quality: Multidimensional Comparisons Across Market Centers (2001) Financial Review, 38, pp. 123-152; Bacidore, J.M., Battalio, R., Jennings, R., Depth improvement and adjusted price improvement on the New York stock exchange (2002) Journal of Financial Markets, 5, pp. 169-195; Bakos, Y., Lucas, H.C., Wonseok, O., Viswanathan, S., Simon, G., Weber, B., (1999) Electronic Commerce in the Retail Brokerage Industry: Trading Costs of Internet versus Full Service Firms, , Working Paper Series Stern #1S99-014; Macey, J., O'Hara, M., The law and economics of best execution (1997) Journal of Financial Intermediation, 6, pp. 188-223; Battalio, R., Greene, J., Hatch, B., Jennings, R., Does the Limit Order Routing Decision Matter?

We examine whether marketplace members (lenders, borrowers) are able to capitalize on borrowers' accumulated social capital. From a borrower's perspective, we investigate the influence of social capital on borrowers' chances to obtain funding and better interest rates in general as well as by borrower groups and over time. From a lender's perspective, we investigate the influence of borrowers' social capital on loan payment. We use data over a time span of two and a half years from Prosper, and analyze more than 200,000 loan requests and 27,500 loans. Our results suggest that social capital does not provide equal benefits to all members of Prosper and that mechanisms to promote social capital should be carefully designed.","E-finance; Electronic markets; Online communities; P2p lending marketplaces","E-finance; Electronic market; Interest rates; Online communities; P2p lending marketplaces; Social capitals; Time span; Commerce; Information systems; Profitability; Finance",,,,,,,,"Adler, P.S., Kwon, S.-W., Social Capital: Prospects for a New Concept (2002) The Academy of Management Review, 27 (1), pp. 17-40; Akerlof, G.A., The Market for 'Lemons': Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism (1970) The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 84 (3), pp. 488-500; Anderson, B., A Look Back at Prosper's Second Year (2007) NuWire Investor, , last accessed May 5th, 2009; Ba, S., Pavlou, P.A., Evidence of the Effect of Trust Building Technology in Electronic Markets: Price Premiums and Buyer Behavior (2002) MIS Quarterly, 26 (3), pp. 243-268; Berger, S., Gleisner, F., Emergence of Financial Intermediaries on Electronic Markets: The Case of Online P2P Lending (2009) Business Research; Forthcoming, , Working Paper from SSRN.com; Bourdieu, P., The Forms of Capital (1986) Handbook of Theory of Research For the Sociology of Education, , J.E.

The disciplinarian existing in the dynamic diffusion process has been found via the study result from many e-financial innovation diffusion processes in the markets of many countries. This paper combined the utility analysis and the series growing coefficient calculation with the basic model for e-financial innovation diffusion utilizing the Verhulst model as its benchmark so as to more accurately determine the point of saturation and more better forecast the diffusion process. In addition, the empirical studies have been done both for Taiwan credit card market and China mainland bank card market. The result will provide the theoretic reference for the strategy making of financial institutions and the regulation making of the supervisor. © 2009 IEEE.","Diffusion model; Finance; Financial innovation","Bank cards; Basic models; Credit cards; Diffusion model; Diffusion process; Dynamic diffusion; Empirical studies; Financial innovation; Financial institution; Utility analysis; Verhulst model; Diffusion; Electronic commerce; Finance",,,,,,,,"Li, C., Yu, J., (2006) The network of financial innovation products in the market for the proliferation of bank card products-An Empirical Study, pp. 85-93. , Financial Research,March; Meade, N., Islam, T., Modelling and forecasting the diffusion of innovation - a 25-year review (2006) Int.

Advancements in information and communication technologies have led to the implementation of web-enabled Business-to-Business (B2B) e-commerce systems to facilitate interorganisational coordination and decision making. Such systems are expensive to implement and yet may fail to achieve business objectives. Therefore, evaluation of how well such systems help organisations achieve goals is a necessity.

This research attempts to suggest a systematic approach to identify the evolution of e-service based on the BM patent database as a quantitative database. Despite the considerable contribution that BM patents can bring to the service world as a valuable database, only a few studies have been conducted on them. This research proposes an algorithm for constructing a BM patent evolution map by selecting major arcs in the patent citation network. Furthermore, the algorithm is applied to the e-finance field to construct and evolution map. The results of this research can be used to understand the process of evolution of e-service, extracting fruitful new service ideas from existing e-service processes or methods, and identifying the legal rights and limitations of created e-service concepts and operation methods. © 2008 IEEE.","Business method patent; E-service; Patent citation analysis; Patent evolution map","Conformal mapping; Database systems; Innovation; Maps; Business method patent; E-service; Legal rights; New services; Operation methods; Patent citation analysis; Patent citations; Patent databases; Patent evolution map; Process of evolutions; Research fields; Scientific methodologies; Service based; Service concepts; Service operations; Service processes; Systematic approaches; Patents and inventions",,,,,,,,"Wu, Y.-C.J., Unlocking the value of business model patents in e-commerce (2005) The Journal of Enterprise Information Management, 18 (1), pp. 113-130; Koda, H., Business Model (2000), Patent, Nikei Kogyo Shinbunsha, Tokyo; Alcorn, L.E., Pursuing Business Method Patents in the (2003), US Patent and Trademark Office, Computer and Internet Lawyer 203, pp. 27-34; USPTO (2003, A USPOT White Paper: Automated Financial or Management Data Processing Methods Business Methods, US Patent and Trademark Office, ver 1.43; Coriat, B., Orsi, F., Establishing a new intellectual property rights regime in the United States: Origins, content and problems (2002) Research Policy, 21 (8-9), pp. 1491-1507; Connor, M.S., Leak, F.W., Challenges of business method patent enforcement-extraterritoriality (2002) Computer and Internet Lawyer, 19 (8), pp. 1-4; Josephberg, K., (2003) Australia reviews business method patents, Intellectual Property & Technology Law Journal, 15 (3), pp. 21-22; Knoke, D., Kuklinski, J., (1982) Network Analysis, , Sage, London; Marseden, P., Laumann, E., Mathematical ideas in social structural analysis (1984) Journal of Mathematical Sociology, 10 (3-4), pp. 271-294; Hummon, N.P., Doreian, P., Connectivity in a citation network: The development of DNA theory (1989) Social Network, 11 (1), pp. 39-63; Verspagen, B., Mapping Technological Trajectories as (2007), Patent Citation Network: A Study on the History of Fuel Cell Research, Advances in Complex Systems 101, pp. 93-115; Batagelj, V., (2003) Efficient Algorithms for Citation network Analysis, , Department of Mathematics, University of Ljubljana; Wasserman, S., Faust, K., (1994) Social Network Analysis: Methods and Applications, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK; Trajtenberg, M., A penny for your quotes: Patent citations and the value of innovations (2002) Patents, Citations and Innovations, , A.

Fingerprint identification is one of the most important security requirements in homeland security systems such as personnel screening and anti-money laundering. The problem of fingerprint identification involves searching (matching) the fingerprint of a person against each of the fingerprints of all registered persons. To enhance performance and reliability, a common approach is to reduce the search space by firstly classifying the fingerprints and then performing the search in the respective class. Jain et al. proposed a fingerprint classification algorithm based on a two-stage classifier, which uses a K-nearest neighbor classifier in its first stage. The fingerprint classification algorithm is based on the fingercode representation which is an encoding of fingerprints that has been demonstrated to be an effective fingerprint biometric scheme because of its ability to capture both local and global details in a fingerprint image. We enhance this approach by improving the efficiency of the K-nearest neighbor classifier for fingercode-based fingerprint classification. Our research firstly investigates the various fast search algorithms in vector quantization (VQ) and the potential application in fingerprint classification, and then proposes two efficient algorithms based on the pyramid-based search algorithms in VQ. Experimental results on DB1 of FVC 2004 demonstrate that our algorithms can outperform the full search algorithm and the original pyramid-based search algorithms in terms of computational efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.

Establishing trust and providing trust-building mechanisms are thus crucial for marketplace providers to reduce uncertainty and risks of online transactions. Business models that focus on consumer-to-consumer (C2C) transactions are growing and prospering. For these business models, establishing trust between consumers is important. Research in e-Commerce has mainly focused on trust-building mechanisms between vendors and consumers, but did not pay as much attention to mechanisms to build trust between individual consumers on C2C platforms. The objective of this study is to empirically investigate and test trust-building mechanisms for C2C platforms using data from the e-Finance marketplace Prosper. Our results give empirical support that trust-building mechanisms such as structural assurances, economic and social cues, as well as content quality influence trusting behavior. We contribute to literature and practice by investigating trust building in C2C relationships. Our findings help online marketplace providers to build successful C2C platforms.","C2C marketplace; Community; e-finance; Trust","Business models; C2C marketplace; Community; Content qualities; e-finance; Online marketplaces; Online markets; Online transaction; Social cues; Trust; Trust building; Electronic commerce; Information systems; Buildings",,,,,,,,"Appan, R., Mellarkod, V., The Impact of Website Design Effectiveness on Customer's Trusting Beliefs About a Pure Internet Retailer: A Conceptual Study (2003) Americas Conference On Information Systems; Ba, S., Pavlou, P.A., Evidence of the Effect of Trust Building Technology in Electronic Markets: Price Premiums and Buyer Behavior (2002) MIS Quarterly, 26 (3), pp. 243-268; Chen, P.-Y., Wu, S.-Y., Yoon, J., The Impact of Online Recommendations and Consumer Feedback on Sales (2004) International Conference On Information Systems; Chen, S.C., Dhillon, G.S., Interpreting Dimensions of Consumer Trust in E-Commerce (2003) Information Technology and Management, (4), pp. 303-318; Fishbein, M., Ajzen, I., (1975) Belief, Attitude, Intention, and Behavior: An Introduction to Theory and Research Reading, Mass, , Don Mills, Ontario: Addison-Wesley Pub.

This is particularly true for the class of e-business applications pertaining to the e-finance domain, where business processes are often distributed across various systems maintained by different organizations. An important activity in the development of such applications is to select the most appropriate architectural design, which can possibly be done by evaluating and selecting from a set of predetermined alternatives, in the form of architectural patterns. In previous work, we have identified and formalized a number of e-business architectural patterns, and also modeled few quality attributes for estimating the patterns' quality consequences. However, since the selection can be affected by several other quality attributes, it is important to determine a way for incorporating these new quality attributes, as they are needed, in an efficient yet simple way. This paper advocates using a hybrid Multiple-Attribute Decision making (MADM) approach in which modeled and non-modeled quality attributes can be jointly considered. The approach is validated using a real case study from the e-finance domain.","Architectural patterns; e-business applications; e-finance; Multiple-Attribute Decision Making","article; automation; case study; commercial phenomena; decision support system; electronic commerce; finance; information technology; quality control; validation study",,,,,,,,"Dabous, F.T., (2005) Pattern-Based Approach for the Architectural Design of e-Business Applications, , Ph.D. thesis, School of Information Systems, Technology and Management, The University of New South Wales, Australia; Yoon, K.P., Hwang, C., (1995) Multiple Attribute Decision Making: An Introduction, , Sage Publications, Thousand Oaks CA; Al-Naeem, T., Dabous, F.T., Rabhi, F.R., Benatallah, B., Quantitative evaluation of enterprise integration patterns (2005) 7th International Conference on Enterprise Information Systems (ICEIS'05), pp. 402-398. , Miami, USA; Anderson, D., Sweeney, D., Williams, T., (2002) An Introduction to Management Science: Quantitative Approaches to Decision Making, , South-Western Educational Publishing; Dabous, F.T., Rabhi, F.A., Exploring architectural design alternatives for business application (2005) IADIS International Conference e-Commerce (IADIS'05), pp. 337-333. , Porto, Portugal; Dabous, F.T., Rabhi, F.A., Yu, H., Al-Naeem, T., Estimating patterns consequences for the architectural design of e-business applications (2005) 7th International Conference on Enterprise Information System (ICEIS'05), pp. 254-248. , Miami, USA; Saaty, T.L., (1980) The Analytic Hierarchy Process, , Columbus, Ohio, McGraw-Hill; Karlsson, J., Ryan, K., A Cost-value approach for prioritizing requirements (1997) IEEE Software, 14, pp. 67-74; Kazman, R., Jai, A., Klein, M., Quantifying the costs and benefits of architectural decisions (2001) 23rd International Conference on Software Engineering, pp. 297-306. , IEEE Computer Society; Blin, M., Tsoukiàs, A., Multi-criteria methodology contribution to the software quality evaluation (2001) Software Quality Journal, 9, pp. 113-132; Svahnberg, M., Wohlin, C., Lundberg, L., Mattsson, M., A Quality-driven decision-support method for identifying software architecture candidates (2003) International Journal of Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering, 13, pp. 547-573; Weber, M., Remarks on the paper: On the measurement of preferences in the analytic hierarchy process (1997) Multicriteria Decision Analytics, 6, pp. 320-321; Dyer, J.S., A Clarification of: Remarks on the analytic hierarchy process (1990) Journal of Management Science, 36 (3), pp. 249-258; Pérez, J., Jimeno, J.L., Mokotoff, E., (2002) Another Potential Strong Shortcoming of AHP, Universidad de Alcalá, , Ph.D. Thesis, Universidad de Alcalá, Madrid, Spain; Al-Naeem, T., Dabous, F.T., Rabhi, F.A., Benatallah, B., Formulating the architectural design of enterprise applications as a search problem (2005) 16th Australian Software Engineering Conference (ASWEC'05), pp. 291-282. , Brisbane, Australia; Al-Naeem, T., Gorton, I., Babar, M.A., Rabhi, F., Benatallah, B., Quality-driven systematic approach for architecting distributed software applications (2005) The 27th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE'05), pp. 253-244. , Missouri, USA","Dabous, F.; College of Computer Science and Information Technology, Abu Dhabi University, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates; email: feras.dabous@adu.ac.ae",,,,,,,,16052587,,AALAB,,"English","Jordan J.

Online Transaction Processing(OLTP) is an essential data processing scheme for e-finance, e-commerce and so on. Conventional researches to improve OLTP performance lack a view from the aspect of preventing performance degradation due to structural deterioration. Recently, more and more business operations and services are being digitized then 24-hours-a-day operation of database is required. Needs for techniques to monitor structural deterioration and prevent performance degradation are increasing more and more. In this paper, we analyze how structural deterioration effects performance degradation in OLTP workload by using a benchmark. We also consider strategies of database mutations which are adaptive to workload and prevent structural deterioration from being accelerated. © 2007 IEEE.",,"Business operation; E finances; Online transaction processing; Performance degradation; Secondary storage; Structural deterioration; Data processing; Database systems; Deterioration; Digital storage; Research; Benchmarking",,,,,,,,"Johnson, T., Shasha, D., B-Trees with inserts and deletes: Why free-at-empty is better than merge-at-half (1993) Journal of Computer and System Sciences, 47 (1), pp. 45-76; Lomet, D.B., Simple, robust and highly concurrent b-trees with node deletion (2004) ICDE, pp. 18-28; Hankins, R.A., Patel, J.M., Effect of node size on the performance of cache-conscious B+trees (2003) SIGMETRICS, pp. 283-294; Dewitt, D., Gray, J., Parallel database systems: The future of high performance database systems (1992) Communications of the ACM, 35 (6), pp. 85-98; Agrawal, S., Narasayya, V.R., Yang, B., Integrating vertical and horizontal partitioning into automated physical database design (2004) SIGMOD Conference, pp. 359-370; Zilio, D.C., Rao, J., Lightstone, S., Lohman, G.M., Storm, A., Garcia-Arellano, C., Fadden, S., Db2 design advisor: Integrated automatic physical database design (2004) VLDB, pp. 1087-1097; Lomet, D., Special issue on online reorganization (1996) IEEE Data Eng.

According to studies and surveys conducted world-wide, government incentives and current legal frameworks, technology available at a reasonable price, and public acceptance of the internet as an efficient medium for buying goods and services are driving e-commerce growth. Academics, information technology experts and even politicians are aware of these essential requirements. The paper gives an overview about the recent decisions, plans and project by the Iranian government to facilitate development of e-commerce in Iran. Unlike developed countries, in developing countries countries like Iran, governments have monopoly on ICT infrastructure and trading procedures. As a result, the main steps toward e-commerce must be taken by the governments. Government of Iran determined to research at formulating policy recommendations on the removal of bottlenecks and problems preventing or slowing down the growth use of new technology in this country. E-commerce has always been an an attentive issue to governments and Iran made some policies to develop and enhance it it such as training this concept as courses in academic institutes and some seminars for industries, regulating the laws, improvements of ICT infrastructure, developing e-finance and e-government and also stimulating activities.

There are many small journals, mostly in English. A majority of these see the potential in online publishing but do not have the resources and capabilities to do so. Furthermore they have a conservative business model (i.e. finances!) that doesn't encourage an open access publishing strategy. The Copenhagen Business School (CBS) Library provides a low risk environment for small journals related to the business school to make a gradual transition to e-publishing/e-archiving. Whether they at a later stage take the full step towards open access publishing remains to be seen.

Design/methodology/approach - To analyze the indirect relationship between the level of connectivity and economic growth via its impact on financial development, generalized method of moments (GMM) is applied to cross section data of 61 countries averaged over 13 years (1990-2002). Findings - In all the regression results, it is found that better connectivity particularly by increasing the number of mobile phone subscribers and the number of internet users significantly enhances financial depth, which is a backbone of any country to grow. Practical implications - Based on the empirical findings of current study, it can be concluded that Claessens et al. might be right in saying that for developing countries to exploit opportunities for leapfrogging even with weak financial system, it is important to invest in the sector of information and communication technology. Originality/value - the current study is the first of its kind, which provides empirical and global evidence that the component of financial sector developed by better telecommunication infrastructure is positively associated with long run economic growth and gross capital formation. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Communication technologies;

A suitable compromise must be determined taking into account business requirements, quality criteria and existing constraints (e.g. presence of legacy systems). This paper adopts the view that for a particular problem context, the architectural design process can be considered as a series of choices regarding the application of a number of architectural design strategies. The problem context described in the paper is common to a category of e-business applications that arise from the e-finance domain. Given a formal representation of this context, we identify and formalise a number of applicable design strategies and show the resulting architectures. We also represent the overall design process as a decision tree and show how quality models can be used to select the most appropriate architecture. The recommendations made by the models are checked against real data from existing projects. © 2006 IEEE.",,"Constraint theory; Electronic commerce; Legacy systems; Mathematical models; Problem solving; Quality assurance; Design process; E-business applications; e-finance; Quality criteria; Computer architecture",,,,,,,,"Al-Naeem, T., Dabous, F.T., Rabhi, F.A., Benatallah, B., Quantitative evaluation of enterprise integration patterns (2005) 7th International Conference on Enterprise Information Systems (ICEIS'05), pp. 398-402. , Miami, USA, May; Anderson, D.R., Sweeney, D.J., Williams, T.A., (2002) An Introduction to Management Science: Quantitative Approaches to Decision Making, , South-Western Educational Publishing; Blin, M., Tsoukis, A., Multi-criteria methodology contribution to the software quality evaluation (2001) Software Quality Journal, 9 (1); Budinsky, F.J., Finnie, M.A., Vlissides, J.M., Yu, P.S., Automatic code generation from design patterns (1996) IBM System Journal, 35 (2), pp. 151-171; Chung, L., Nixon, B.A., Yu, E., (1999) Non-functional Requirements in Software Engineering, , Kluwer Academic Publishing, Posten MA; (2005), http://www.cmcrc.com, Last accessed on Mar; X-STREAM System, , http://www.computershare.com.au; Dabous, F.T., (2005) Pattern-based Approach for the Architectural Design of e-Business Applications, , Phd thesis, School of Information Systems, Technology and Management, The University of New South Wales, Australia; Dabous, F.T., Rabhi, F.A., Yu, H., Performance issues in integrating a capital market surveillance system (2003) Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering (WISE'03), pp. 287-290. , Rome, Italy, December; Dabous, F.T., Rabhi, F.A., Yu, H., Al-Naeem, T., Estimating patterns consequences for the architectural design of e-business applications (2005) 7th International Conference on Enterprise Information Systems (ICEIS'05), pp. 248-254. , Miami, USA, May; (2005), http://www.financeit.unsw.edu.au; Harris, L., (2003) Trading and Exchanges: Market Microstructure for Practitioners, , Oxford University Press; Karlsson, J., Ryan, K., A cost-value approach for prioritizing requirements (1997) IEEE Software, 14 (5); Kazman, R., Asundi, J., Klein, M., Quantifying the costs and benefits of architectural decisions (2001) The 23rd Internationa Conference on Sofware Engineering, pp. 297-306. , IEEE Computer Society, May; http://www.sirca.com.au; http://www.smarts-systems.com; Svahnberg, M., Wohlin, C., Lundberg, L., Mattsson, M., A quality-driven decision-support method for identifying software architecture candidates (2003) International Journal of Soft-ware Engineering and Knowledge Engineering, 13 (5), pp. 547-573; Weiss, M., Pattern-driven design of agent systems: Approach and case study (2003) LNCS, 2681, pp. 711-723. , Conference on Advanced Information Systems engineering (CAiSE), LNCS 2681, Springer; Yoon, K.P., Hwang, C.-L., Multiple attribute decision making: An introduction (1995) Saga Publications; Yu, H., Rabhi, F.A., Dabous, F.T., An exchange service for financial markets (2004) Proceedings 6th International Conference on Enterprise Information Systems (ICEIS'04), pp. 403-410. , Porto, Portugal, April; Zhang, H., Jarzabek, S., A bayesian network approach to rational architectural design (2005) IJSEKE, 15 (4)","Dabous, F.T.; School of Information Systems Technology and Management, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; email: f.dabous@unsw.edu.au",,,,"2006 Australian Software Engineering Conference, ASWEC 2006","18 April 2006 through 21 April 2006","Sydney",68337,,0769525512; 9780769525518,,,"English","Proc Aust Software Eng Conf ASWEC",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33750143822

In my study I try to look at the developments this new status quo has brought about, even if we are quite sure that the adoption of the common currency will cause bigger steps forward in the integration process. I also have a look at another factor influencing the financial services almost as much as the European integration, namely, the development of e-finance. Finally, I make an attempt to draw a picture of the Hungarian financial services sector a few years from now. © Springer-Verlag/Wien 2006.","e-Finance; Financial services; Hungary",,,,,,,,,"Balogh, C., Gabriel, P., Development tendencies of interbanking money markets (2003) Muhelytanulmányok, 28. , Magyar Nemzeti Bank, Budapest; Introducing ourselves (2006) Befektetési Alapkezelok Magyarországi Szövetsé ge, , www.bamosz.hu, Bamosz, Budapest, January 8, 2006; (2005) Beszámoló a Bankszövetség 2004, , BSZ. évi tevékenységérol (Annual report 2004).

The original problem is similar to a typical Sum of Subset problem that might be solved by a backtracking algorithm and the problem complexity is NP-complete. Usually BCB finds controllers manually, which is time consuming and prone to errors for a large financial institution. Based on the property of the distribution of stock shares, a heuristic approximation algorithm was developed with polynomial complexity O(n3). The paper describes the basic concepts and business rules currently employed at BCB, the algorithm and its major subroutines. It also gives a brief complexity analysis, an illustrative example and a case study for Atlântida Bank. Web on-line application of the system since 2003 indicates the feasibility and trustworthiness of this automation process. Though developed for BCB, it works equally well for the related financial institutions. © 2006 - IOS Press and the authors.

Specifically, the e-finance model is comprised of four components: 1 digital wealth creation 2 digital wealth collection 3 digital wealth management 4 digital wealth protection. The four components constitute the Creat e-Collect-Manage-Protect (CCMP) model. Extensions of Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) with CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture) and web services are presented to demonstrate the value-added implications of a networked approach to business digitisation. The e-finance model offers a new view to broaden the present understanding of e-finance from the technology perspective and shapes the basis for strategic decision making.

This paper aims to better understanding of how personality traits affect the acceptance of e-finance by incorporating personality traits into the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model. Our findings suggest that personality traits have significant moderating effects on influencing behavioural intentions.

The ownership structure is considered as: (1) concentrated ownership, (2) different types of concentrated ownership and (3) managerial ownership. It adopted Market Returns (MR) and accounting ratios as measures of performance. It reports that there is a positive association between concentrated ownership and firm performance. The results show that different types of concentrated ownership have positive relationships to performance measures. It, however, does not find any evidence to support the existence of a non-linear relationship between managerial ownership and firm performance. © 2006 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Electronic finance;

The collaborative coupons schemes, whilst primarily aimed at promotion scheme, are not limited to such schemes, but also address the new way of implementing e-payment activities. © 2006 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Collaborative coupons; E-finance; Electronic payment (e-payment); Mileage; Trust",,,,,,,,,"Bai, L., Chou, D.C., Yen, D.C., Lin, B., Mobile commerce: Its market analysis (2005) International Journal of Mobile Communications, 3 (1), pp. 66-81; Bootle, R., The future of electronic money: Why the nok will not replace the dollar (2001) The Business Economist, 32 (1), pp. 7-15; Cave, J., Valeri, L., Cyber-trust (2004) EAdoption and Knowledge Economy, 1 (1), pp. 188-195; Chan, W.K., Wickramasinghe, N., Using the internet for financial disclosures: The Australian experience (2006) International Journal of Electronic Finance, 1 (1), pp. 118-150; Ferreira, L.C., Dahab, R., A scheme for analyzing electronic payment system (1998) Fourteenth Computer Security Applications Conference, pp. 37-146; Hart, P., Saunders, C., Power and trust: Critical factors in the adoptions and use of electronic data interchange (1997) Organizational Science, 8 (1), pp. 23-42; Hauser, R., Steiner, M., Waidner, M., Micro-payments based on ikp (1996) IBM Reports, , http://www.zurich.ibm.com/publications/1996/HSW96.ps.gz/, Retrieved on 20 December 2004; Huber, J., Robertson, J., (2000) Creating New Money: A Monetary Reform for the Information Age, , London: New Economics Foundation; Hwang, M.S., Lin, I.C., Li, L.H., A simple micro-payment scheme (2001) The Journal of Systems and Software, 55 (3), pp. 221-229; Keen, P.G.W., Are you ready for 'trust' economy?

After presenting an overview of our unified architecture, we focus on the state-of-the-art architectural components for user interaction in future systems - particularly multimedia voice interaction with intelligent systems. This paper shows how user-level conversational data mining (CDM) methods, coupled with biometric security, and enhanced with privacy-awareness, may be used with any Web information system architecture. Finally, we provide an example of our unified architecture through integrating a knowledge architecture for an e-finance application in the financial services domain.

This paper describes HiLεX, a system implementing a novel logic-based approach to information extraction from unstructured documents. The approach adopted in the HiLεX system is founded on a new two-dimensional representation of documents, and heavily exploits DLP+ - an extension of disjunctive logic programming for ontology representation and reasoning, which has been recently implemented on top of the DLV system. Unlike previous systems, which are mainly syntactic, HiLεX combines both semantic and syntactic knowledge for a powerful information extraction. Ontologies, representing the semantics of the domain of the information to be extracted, are encoded in DLP+, while the extraction patterns are encoded by regular expressions in an ad hoc two-dimensional grammar. These regular expressions are (internally) translated into DLP+ rules, whose execution yields the actual extraction of information from the input document. HiLεX allows the semantic information extraction from both HTML pages and flat text documents. The usefulness of Hilex has been already confirmed also in practice, as the system has been successfully employed in two advanced applications in the e-health and e-finance domains. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.",,"Electronic document identification systems; Formal logic; Logic programming; Management information systems; Problem solving; Semantics; E-health; Knowledge management; Ontologies; Semantic information extraction; Information retrieval",,,,,,,,"Baumgartner, R., Flesca, S., Gottlob, G., Declarative information extraction, web crawling, and recursive wrapping with lixto (2001) Proc.

The most important of them are solvency and financial risk, including the ratio of current assets to current liabilities, the ratio of current assets minus stocks to current liabilities, the ratio of equity to liabilities, the ratio of assets to liabilities and the ratio of current assets to equity. These values indicate how efficiently various resources, i. e. finances, materials, manpower, etc. are used at an enterprise. The criteria characterizing the financial state of an enterprise from various perspectives may change in different directions. Moreover, these criteria are multidimensional. Therefore, a problem of finding a unified approach to describe this conflicting situation arises. The particular criteria describe the particular aspects of a complex object. To obtain an integrated estimate of a considered object, multicriteria evaluation methods are applied. Being versatile, these methods are used for solving various problems. A great number of methods evaluating the performance of multidimensional objects have been created and used recently. Each method has some advantages in describing the particular features of an object. Most methods use various techniques for normalization or transformation of the initial data. In the present investigation seven methods of multicriteria evaluation are applied. The calculations made yielded actually the same results, except those obtained by two methods - the sum of ranks and VIKOR. However, the deviation of the data obtained by using these methods from the average value was small. The priority order of enterprises is finally determined integrating the results obtained by all methods used in the present analysis.","Assessment of the financial state; Construction enterprise; Multicriteria evaluation methods",,,,,,,,,"McLaney, E.J., (1997) Business Finance: Theory and Practice, p. 422. , (fourth edition).

Our results show that perceived efficiency, system reliability, customer service, and personal characteristics are significantly positive in explaining the degree of e-finance usage. Among these, the personal characteristics factor is the most influential one implying that financial institutions need to primarily target these group of customers to diffuse the e-finance system. However, our results do not support such factors as technical aspect and user interface of the system. This reveals that these factors are not considered important by the customers when they try to intensify the e-finance usages. However, it would not necessarily imply that these factors are not important in operating e-finance systems because the technical abilities of South Korean financial institutions have been developed almost at the same pace, and consequently customers could hardly recognize the differences across the systems offered by different firms. © 2005 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

Legacy systems are valuable assets that must play an important role in this process. Selecting the most appropriate architectural design for an e-business application would have critical impact on participating enterprises. This paper discusses an initiative towards a systematic framework that would assist in identifying a range of possible alternative architectural designs for such applications and how some of these alternatives can evolve into formal architectural patterns or anti-patterns. This paper focuses on e-business applications with some requirements and assumptions that are often presented in a few specific domains such as e-finance. The concepts presented in this paper are demonstrated using a real life case study in the domain of e-finance and in particular capital markets trading.","Architectural design; E-business applications; E-finance; Legacy systems; Patterns","Anti-patterns; Architectural pattern; Capital markets; E finances; E-business applications; Life case; Patterns; Systematic framework; Commerce; Industry; Legacy systems; World Wide Web; Architectural design",,,,,,,,"Al-Naeem, T., Dabous, F.T., Rabhi, F.A., Beatallah, B., Formulating the architectural design of enterprise applications as a search problem (2005) Australian Software Engineering Conference (ASWEC 2005), , Australia.

In many domains, these applications may utilise functionalities that are embedded in a number of monolithic and heterogeneous legacy systems. In previous work, we have identified a range of patterns that capture best practices for the architectural design of such applications with the presence of legacy functionality. In this paper, we present and discuss quantitative patterns' consequences models to systematically estimate two quality attributes that are the development and maintenance efforts. A real life case study in the domain of e-finance and in particular capital markets trading is used in this paper to validate these models.","Development methodology; E-Business applications; E-Finance; Legacy systems; Patterns","Best-practices; Business Process; Capital markets; Design process; Development methodology; E-Business applications; E-Finance; Patterns; Quality attributes; Architectural design; Electronic commerce; Embedded systems; Estimation; Information systems; Management information systems; Legacy systems",,,,,,,,"Al-Naeem, T., Dabous, F.T., Rabhi, F.A., Benatallah, B., Quantitative evaluation of enterprise integration patterns (2005) 7th Int.

In order to make living more convenient, the mobile payment has been brought up in recent years. The consideration for carrying out the mobile payment is very difference from that in the wired electronics payment scheme because of the characteristics of mobile device. In this article we develop a mobile payment scheme that is based on reducing the operation of the device, and furthermore achieves the demands of security. It can create the session key for each transaction by means of using the ""Diffie-Hellman key exchange"" protocol. The use of the Message Authentication Code (MAC) can achieve the integrity of electronic commerce. Both of them do not need a large number of operations and complex algorithm so it can achieve the purposes of this investigation: a secure, convenient and light-computation scheme for mobile payment.","Authentication code; E-finance; Key exchange; Mobile payment","Authentication codes; Complex algorithms; Daily activity; Diffie-Hellman key exchange; Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol; E finances; Key exchange; Message authentication codes; Mobile communications; Mobile payment; Payment schemes; Session key; Electronic commerce; Mobile devices; Supply chains; Global system for mobile communications",,,,,,,,"http://www.cybercash.com/; http://www.paybox.com/; http://www.mobipay.com/; Helanto, P., (2002) Sonera Mobile Operations, , Sonera Corporation, March; The PayPal phenomenon (2002) EC Research Report, , CommerceNet Taiwan, Jan; (1997) SET Protocol Specifications, , http://www.setco.org/set_specifications.html, Mastercard and Visa; Bellare, M., Garay, J.A., Hauser, R., Herzberg, A., Krawczyk, H., Steiner, M., Tsudik, G., Waidner, M., Design, implementation, and deployment of the ikp secure electronic payment system (2000) IEEE Journal of Selected Areas in Communications; Diffie, W., Hellman, M., New directions in cryptography (1976) IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 22 (6), pp. 644-654; Schneier, B., (1996) Applied Cryptography Second Edition, p. 514. , John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

As a result of the internet era of the1990's, IT has become more pervasive and requires more depth and breadth of knowledge across the business functions and strategy. Likewise, students concentrating in any of the other business disciplines (i.e., finance, marketing, accounting) require more knowledge of technology and this trend will continue. A global perspective will also continue to be more important. MBA programs have responded to these demands in various ways. Four curriculum models were identified that capture the majority of current MBA program trends. Top ranked MBA programs were examined in this study since these programs provide leadership and direction for other schools. More empirical research is required but this preliminary study shows an overwhelming trend toward more integration of IT in the overall MBA program.","IT curriculum; MBA; Rankings; Trends","Business functions; Curriculum models; Empirical research; Global perspective; MBA; Rankings; Trends; Curricula; Information science; Information technology; Research; Education computing",,,,,,,,"Celsi, R., Wolfinbarger, M., Creating renaissance employees in an era of convergence between information technology and business strategy: A proposal for business schools (2001) Journal of Education for Business, 76 (6), p. 308; Crowley, A., These students are in a class of their own; Leading business schools enrolling MBA candidates in IT curriculum (1997) PC Week, 14 (16), p. 109; Desai, M.S., Von Der Embse, T., A synergistic strategy for MIS curriculum development: Response to a rapidly advancing information technology (2001) College Student Journal, 35 (4), p. 552; Dyer, J., Lasdon, L., Ruefli, T.W., The techno-MBA: The key to the success of management science in business schools (1998) Selections, 15 (1), p. 7; Elliott, C.J., Goodwin, J.S., Goodwin, J.C., MBA programs and business needs: Is there a mismatch?

We take a look at the potential benefits of mobile financial information pull and push services and also determine the security requirements of such services comparing them with what current technology has to offer.

Based on an empirical survey with Germany's Fortune 1,000 firms, it is shown that managers without prior outsourcing experience substantially overestimate the firm's in-house competencies compared to external experts. The picture changes for managers with experience, establishing an important cultural barrier to outsourcing.","Competence; E-Finance; Economies of Scale; Experience; Financial Chain; Outsourcing; Scope; Skill",,,,,,,,,"Ajzen, I., The Theory of planned behavior (1991) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50 (1), pp. 79-211. , [Ajze91]; Arkhipov, A.V., Yong, A., Show me the money (2001) How E-business Will Transform B-to-B Financial Processes, , [ArYo01].

Now cyberspaces are rapidly expanding on the Web either intentionally or spontaneously, with or without design. Widespread and intensive local activities are melting each other on the web globally to create cyberworlds. The major key players of cyberworlds include e-finance that trades a GDP-equivalent a day and e-manufacturing that is transforming industrial production into Web shopping of product components and assembly factories. Lacking proper theory and design, cyberworlds have continued to grow chaotic and are now out of human understanding and control. This research first presents a generic theoretical framework and design based on algebraic topology, and also provides an axiomatic approach to theorize the potentials of cyberworlds.

Hence, it is intended for those formulating policies in the area of electronic security and those working with financial services providers (such as executives and management). The detailed annexes of this monograph are relevant for chief information and security officers and others who are responsible for securing network systems. First, the monograph defines electronic finance (e-finance) and electronic security (e-security) and explains why these areas require attention. Next, it presents a picture of the emerging global security industry. Then, it develops a risk management framework to assist policymakers and practitioners in understanding the tradeoffs and risks inherent in using an open network infrastructure. It also provides examples of tradeoffs that may arise with respect to technological innovations, privacy, quality of service, and security in the design of an e-security policy framework. Finally, it outlines issues in four critical and interrelated areas that require attention in the building of an adequate e-security infrastructure. These are: (i) the legal, regulatory, and enforcement framework; (ii) external monitoring of e-security practices; (iii) public-private sector cooperation; and (iv) the business case for practicing layered e-security that will improve internal monitoring.",,"e-commerce; financial services; regulatory approach; safety",,,,,,,,"Allen, J., (2001) CERT Guide to System and Network Security Practices, , Indianapolis, Ind.: Addison-Wesley; (2003) International Corporate Privacy Handbook, , American Bar Association.

With the rapid growth of Internet technology is recent years, e-finance has become a vital application of e-commerce. However, in this ""sea"" of information, made available through the Internet, an ""intelligent"" financial web-mining and stock prediction system can be a key to success. In this paper, the author introduces the iJADE Stock Advisor - an intelligent agent-based stock prediction system using our proposed hybrid radial basis-function recurrent network (HRBFN). By using ten-year stock pricing information (1990-1999), consisting of 33 major Hong Kong stocks for testing, the iJADE Stock Advisor has achieved promising results in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and mobility as compared with other contemporary stock prediction models. Also, various analyzes on this stock advisory system have been performed: including round trip time (RTT) analysis, window-size evaluation test (for both long-term trend and short-term prediction), and stock prediction performance test.","iJADE model; Intelligent agents; Nuero-oscillatory model; Recurrent neural network; Stock prediction","Computer simulation; Inventory control; Java programming language; Radial basis function networks; Recurrent neural networks; Stock forecasts; Stock prediction system; Intelligent agents",,,,,"Hong Kong Polytechnic University, PolyU","Manuscript received August 7, 2002; revised April 7, 2003, October 6, 2003, and January 2, 2004.

As a result, substantial optimization potential remains unexploited. Based on an empirical study, in this paper a generic financial chain is developed and used to identify areas for improvement. Especially the invoicing subprocess offers great potential for integration. 28% of all invoices are incorrect, mostly (83%) due to faulty prices. Thus, an internal integration of the systems used for pricing and invoicing customers can substantially cut down the associated costs of claim management. But integrating the invoicing systems with external partners is also important. German SMEs send 86% of all invoices to customers by mail. In Fortune 1000 enterprises the figure is 67%. Here, overall average costs per invoice are € 15,50 in contrast to € 2,00 for electronic invoices.","E-Finance; Electronic Bill Presentment and Payment (EBPP); Financial Chain; Financial Chain Management; Financial Process; Invoice",,,,,,,,,"Arkhipov, A.V., Yong, A., (2001) Show Me the Money: How e-Business Will Transform B-to-B Financial Processes, , Report, Aberdeen Group Inc., Boston; Beam, C., Segev, A., Automated Negotiations: A Survey of the State-of-the-Art (1997) Wirtschaftsinformatik, 39 (3), pp. 269-279; Böhle, K., (2001) The Potential of Server-based Internet Payment Systems, , Background Paper, Electronic Payment Systems Observatory (ePSO), Seville; Bodendorf, F., Robra-Bissantz, S., (2003) E-Finance - Elektronische Dienstleistungen in der Finanzwirtschaft, , München, Wien; Braßler, A., Schneider, H., Stand und Entwicklungstendenzen des Electronic Supply Chain Management (2001) zfo Zeitschrift Führung und Organisation, 70 (3), pp. 143-150; Buxmann, P., Ladner, F., Weitzel, T., Anwendung der Extensible Markup Language (XML): Konzeption und Implementierung einer WebEDI-Lösung (2001) Wirtschaftsinformatik, 43 (3), pp. 257-267; Büschgen, H.E., (1998) Bankbetriebslehre.

Electronic finance commerce becomes popular and especially online security tradings becoome very popular in this area. This online securitiy tradings have some good points such as less mistakes than telephone calls. In order to expand this online security tradings, the transfer of the security paper is one the largest problems to be solved. Because it takes a few days to transfer the security paper from a seller to a buyer. So the dematerialization of security papers is one of the solutions. The demterilization needs the information systems for setteling security. Some countries such as France, German, United Kingdom and U.S.A. have been strating the dematerialization projects. The legacy assesments on these projects focus from the viewpoint of the legal schemes only and there is no assessment from system architectures. This paper focuses on the information system scheme and valuates these dematerlization projects by AHP methods from the viewpoints of “dematerializaion of security papers”, “speed of transfer”, “usefulness on the system” and “accumulation of risks”. This is the first case of valuations on security settlements systems by AHP methods, especially four counties' systems. © 2004, The Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This investigation met the criteria for an exemption from institutional review board approval. A cross-sectional study in which a validated national survey was sent to members of the Society of Chairmen of Academic Radiology Departments (SCARD) was conducted. The survey was designed to examine the following six categories of 28 performance indicators: (a) general organization, (b) volume and productivity, (c) radiology reporting, (d) access to examinations, (e) customer satisfaction, and (f) finance. A total of 158 variables were included in the analysis. Summary statistics, the chi(2) test, rank correlation, multiple regression analysis, and analysis of variance were used. RESULTS: A response rate of 42% (55 of 132 SCARD members) was achieved. The mean number of performance indicators used by radiology departments was 16 +/- 6.35 (standard deviation). The most frequently utilized performance indicators were as follows: (a) productivity, in terms of examination volume (78% [43 departments]) and examination volume per modality (78% [43 departments]); (b) reporting, in terms of report turnaround (82% [45 departments]) and transcription time (71% [39 departments]); (c) access, in terms of appointment access to magnetic resonance imaging (80% [44 departments]); (d) satisfaction, in terms of number of patient complaints (84% [46 departments]); and (e) finance, in terms of expenses (67% [37 departments]). Regression analysis revealed that the numbers of performance indicators in each category were statistically significant in predicting the total number of performance indicators used (P < .001 for all). Numbers of productivity and financial indicators were moderately correlated (r = 0.51). However, there were no statistically significant correlations between the numbers of performance indicators used and hospital location, hospital size, or department size (P > .4 for all). CONCLUSION: Assessing departmental performance with a wide range of management indicators is not yet an established and standardized practice in academic radiology departments in the United States. Among all indicators, productivity indicators are the most frequently used.

As the world's largest developing country, China has made faster S&T progress and innovation, a priority in its economic and social development, with a view to maintain a sustained, rapid, and sound development of the economy in response to the opportunities and challenges after its WTO accession. Since the founding of the People's Republic more than half a century ago, China's S&T cause has grown from scratch and made gigantic strides. However, China still lags considerably in making the shift from imitating others to making original innovation, from emphasizing single technological breakthrough to strengthening integrated technological upgrading, and from stressing technology orientation to promoting product and industry orientation. To quickly secure commanding heights in the 21st century hi-tech industries and achieve breakthrough in certain major technologies and their commercialization during the post-WTO grace period, the Chinese government has decided to launch a number of special S&T items and looks forward to their substantive success in five years. These include super large IC and software, information security, e-government and e-finance, electricity-powered automobile, functional genomics and biochips, dairy products, new drugs, and modernization of traditional Chinese medicine. In the IT area, efforts are being made to fundamentally change the basic monopoly of core foreign technologies by developing its own new concept of CPU, NC, and network software platforms. It aims to reverse the situation of not having drug products with China's own proprietary technologies by stepping up the R&D of new drugs and modernization of traditional Chinese medicine. In the area of transportation, it aims at technological breakthroughs and commercialization of electricity-powered automobile to gain an upper hand in the new round of competition. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the best search engines index only approximately 20% of the static pages. So the real question is: While the Web is certainly the most amazing and comprehensive information source ever created, are you really getting all the information you need for your specific purpose? The answer to this question is mostly ""yes"" for the individual user, who uses the Web as an information source for casual purposes. However, for an individual who uses the Web as an essential and comprehensive source of information - for business or research - the answer is quite the opposite. Even a sophisticated Web user requires a significant amount of time and effort to find all of the information needed for a given task. In this paper the concept of Web Business Intelligence (WBI) is introduced, an emerging class of software that leverages the unprecedented content on the Web to extract actionable knowledge in an organizational setting. The contributions include an architecture for WBI, a survey of technologies relevant to the various components of the architecture, and illustration of the value of WBI by means of a detailed example from the e-finance domain. This article concludes with a discussion on the future of WBI.","Artificial Intelligence; Computers-Computer Science; Data Bases","Data bases; Web business intelligence (WBI); Web content acquisition; Web-usage mining (WUM); Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Data mining; Indexing (of information); Information retrieval; Information technology; Knowledge acquisition; Mathematical models; User interfaces; World Wide Web",,,,,,,,"Agarwal, R.C., Aggarwal, C.C., Prasad, V.V.V., A tree projection algorithm for generation of frequent itemsets (2001) J. of Parallel and Distributed Comput., 61, pp. 350-371; Agrawal, R., Srikant, R., Past algorithms for mining association rules (1994) Proc. of the 20th VLDB Conference, pp. 487-499. , Santiago, Chile.

Geojit Securities was the first to go online. On 1st february 2000, the National Stock Exchange (NSE) opened up the internet-based trading system for its members, the first stock exchange in India to do so. However, after two years of trading, only a dozen brokers continue offering online service. The SEBI Committee on Internet-based Securities Trading and Services has allowed the net to be used as an Order Routing System (ORS) through registered stockbrokers on behalf of their clients for execution of transactions. This paper aims at understanding the needs of the customers, comparing it with the offerings of the websites, identifying the gaps, and offering possible solutions for filling up the gaps. It is revealed that: Online traders took buying decisions on their own. A few backed it up by analysts’ recommendations. Those who took decisions independently claimed to go through the websites, did fundamental and technical analysis, watched the trends, and then finally made a decision. No one solely followed brokers’ recommendations blindly. Well-educated people in their 30s and 40s, who were highly informed and also knew how to tap sources of information, took decisions on their own and did not depend upon the broker. They were self-directed traders. The major perceived benefit of online system was its convenience. The broker’s reliability followed by the execution speed was the key to logging on to a website. An analysis of the Indian sites indicated that they were mainly promotional and provisional in nature. Provisional information about stock quotes, database searches, research reports, etc. were provided in the site empowering the user to take independent decisions. Promotional activities in the form of facilities locator, educational forums, web designs, demos, etc. had lured many to visit their sites but whether this had converted into online clients could not be confirmed from the results of this study. Indian websites offered a basic plain package with lot of scope remaining for value addition. Excluding the technical and legal aspects over which the e-finance service providers did not have much control, certain value additions could be done on the existing websites. Moreover, the Indian investors having access to the foreign websites were quite well versed with what was being offered by the American counterparts and hence they were highly demanding customers. The following services could make Indian sites more attractive to customers: • Interactive counselling • Customer care centre • Investment tips • Warning systems • Extended hours trade • Account management • Inter-organizational alliances. © 2017, SAGE Publications Ltd.

Thus most of its marketing energy has been directed toward new member enrollment strategies. As health plans mature in their industry life cycle, measures to retain present members and prevent disenrollment will become increasingly important. Health plan disenrollment is indeed costly and can have serious consequences on the viability of the health plan by causing retention of primarily high risk, costly utilizers in the plan. Superior attitude, service and care is necessary to retain healthy employees who do not feel forced to stay in a supposedly mediocre health care arrangement. Marketing thinking is essential in the daily operations of the entire organization. Often this is difficult to enforce, as various organizational departments of the health plan are rewarded for non-marketing objectives, i.e. finance and ROI (return on investment). Customer service tends to be misunderstood, easily forgotten in the event of success, and is not typically a priority for non-marketing staff. Thus, by constantly encouraging the staff and physicians to actively employ marketing concepts, consumer satisfaction with the health plan should increase while disenrollment should be reduced.",,"cost benefit analysis; economic aspect; health care planning; health care utilization; human; marketing; organization and management; short survey; Consumer Satisfaction; Health Benefit Plans, Employee; Health Maintenance Organizations; Insurance, Health; Marketing of Health Services; Planning Techniques; United States",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,00257257,,MGRMA,"10302219","English","MED.

Prior to making initial screening decisions about a male or female applicant for a traditionally male job, i.e., finance manager trainee, 147 college students read an editorial documenting the successful performance of an individual woman or a group of women employed in a nontraditional job that either was or was not related to the job about which the personnel recommendations were to be made. A neutral information group read an editorial unrelated to women or work. As predicted, the discrepant ratings of male and female applicants in the neutral baseline condition were significantly reduced only when the information presented concerned a group of women and there also was a direct connection between the occupation in which they were successful and the occupation for which the screening decision was being made. Additional analyses supported the idea that this effect was due to the lessening of the stereotypie attributes used to characterize the female applicants. These results suggest that although exposure to successful women in heretofore male dominated occupations can reduce sex bias in personnel selection decisions, the conditions under which this is likely to occur are very limited. The implications of these results, both theoretical and practical, are discussed. © 1986.",,,,,,,,,,"Allport, (1954) The nature of prejudice, , Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA; Anderson, Ripples throughout society: How putting Ferraro on the ticket opens big new possibilities (1984) Time, 124 (4), pp. 34-35; Bigoness, Effect of applicant's sex, race, and performance on employer's performance ratings: Some additional findings (1976) Journal of Applied Psychology, 61, pp. 80-84; Broverman, Vogel, Broverman, Clarkson, Rosenkrantz, Sex-role stereotypes A current appraisal (1972) Journal of Social Issues, 28, pp. 59-78; Cash, Gillen, Burns, Sexism and “beautyism” in personnel consultant decision making (1977) Journal of Applied Psychology, 62, pp. 301-311; Cohen, Bunker, Subtle effects of sex role stereotypes on recruiters hiring decisions (1975) Journal of Applied Psychology, 60, pp. 566-572; Dipboye, Wiley, Reactions of college recruiters to interviewer sex and self-presentation style (1977) Journal of Vocational Behavior, 10, pp. 1-12; Eagly, Steffen, Gender stereotypes stem from the distribution of women and men into social roles (1984) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 46, pp. 735-754; Hamner, Kim, Baird, Bigoness, Race and sex as determinants of ratings by potential employers in a simulated work-sampling task (1974) Journal of Applied Psychology, 59, pp. 705-711; Heilman, The impact of situational factors on personnel decisions concerning women: Varying the sex composition of the applicant pool (1980) Organizational Behavior and Human Performance, 26, pp. 386-395; Heilman, Understanding occupational sex bias (1983) Research in organizational behavior, 5. , B Staw, L Cummings, JAI, Greenwich, CT; Heilman, Information as a deterrent against sex discrimination: The effects of applicant sex and information type on preliminary employment decisions (1984) Organizational Behavior and Human Performance, 33, pp. 174-186; Heilman, Saruwatari, When beauty is beastly: The effects of appearance and sex on evaluations of job applicants for managerial and nonmanagerial jobs (1979) Organizational Behavior and Human Performance, 23, pp. 360-372; Heilman, Stopeck, Being attractive, advantage or disadvantage?: Performance based evaluations and recommended personnel actions as a function of appearance, sex and job type (1985) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 35, pp. 202-215; Katz, The functional approach to the study of attitudes (1960) Public Opinion Quarterly, 24, pp. 163-204; Schein, The relationship between sex-role stereotypes and requisite management characteristics (1973) Journal of Applied Psychology, 57, pp. 95-100; Schein, The relationship between sex-role stereotypes and requisite management characteristics among female managers (1975) Journal of Applied Psychology, 60, pp. 340-344; Taylor, Ilgen, Sex discrimination against women in initial placement decisions A laboratory investigation (1981) Academy of Management Journal, 24, pp. 859-865; Terborg, Ilgen, A theoretical approach to sex discrimination in traditionally masculine occupations (1975) Organizational Behavior and Human Performance, 13, pp. 352-376; Tversky, Kahneman, Availability: A heuristic for judging frequency and probability (1973) Cognitive Psychology, 5, pp. 207-232; Tversky, Kahneman, Judgment under uncertainty: Heuristics and biases (1974) Science (Washington, D.C.), 185, pp. 1124-1131; Weber, Crocker, Cognitive processes in the revision of Stereotypie beliefs (1983) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 45, pp. 961-977","Heilman, M.E.; New York UniversityUnited States",,,,,,,,07495978,,OBDPF,,"English","Organ.

First, the problem of implementing financial decision theory in practical decision situations and, second, the need to develop existing managerial financial models. A discussion of organization decision processes indicates possible reasons for the relative failure of management science and financial theory based models in practice and the predominance of accounting based models. This analysis of strategic decision processes suggests key design features for the implementation of financial models. Finally, research orientated models designed using these guidelines are seen as appropriate media for the transfer of knowledge between financial decision theory and financial practice. This is seen as providing a tentative basis for the development of managerial financial models. Throughout the paper the author uses examples from his own experience in model building in instalment credit, and leasing financial intermediaries, i.e. “Finance Houses”.
